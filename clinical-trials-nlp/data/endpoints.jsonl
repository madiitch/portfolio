Despite its increasing popularity and safety, the abdomen remains a major source of postoperative pain. Adequate pain control is important as it has been shown to reduce medical complications, in-hospital death, shortens hospital stay, lessen chronic pain and disability, and in turn lower health-care costs. The current postoperative pain relief protocol consists primarily of a patient-controlled anesthesia device delivering intravenous opioids. Opioids can cause numerous side-effects such as sedation, headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties, bladder and bowel dysfunction. A promising approach to provide postoperative pain control of the abdominal incision is the newly developed transversus abdominis plane (TAP) peripheral nerve block. Although the TAP block has been found to be an effective pain-relief following major abdominal surgeries, its use has never been studied for breast reconstruction using abdominal tissue. Therefore, the investigators propose to rigorously study the efficacy of a TAP block in reducing postoperative abdominal pain following abdominal tissue breast reconstruction. This study has significant implications in improving both clinical care and health outcomes in patients undergoing this common method of breast reconstruction technique.", "phase": "PHASE4", "condition": "Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block Catheter", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["a TAP block in reducing postoperative abdominal pain following abdominal tissue breast reconstruction"]}

Patients will be accrued from Northwestern University and University of Chicago. Effects are defined in terms of swallowing function, morbidity, toxicity and survival.

These are derived from monocytes extracted from the peripheral blood of the patient, cultured in vitro using cytokines, which endow them with the capability to promote angiogenesis and tissue repair. Preliminary animal experiments and European clinical studies have shown that injecting OPM cells into the muscle around diabetic ulcers increases the paracrine of proteins related to angiogenesis and tissue recovery, promotes the regeneration and repair of tissue structure and function, and activates precursor cells or naive cells (including tissue-oriented stem cells) that are dormant or suppressed within tissues and organs. These cells replace and reconstruct the cells and tissues that have been damaged and lost function due to disease, thereby restoring physiological functions.\n\nTo explore whether this therapy can repair local ulcers in the limbs of diabetic patients, Shanghai Oriental Hospital, in collaboration with Van der Rijt (Shanghai) Biotechnology Co., Ltd., has initiated this exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of OPM cells in the treatment of diabetic ulcers.\n\nStudy Objective： As a clinical study initiated by researchers, this study aims to explore the safety and preliminary efficacy of OPM cells in reducing complications in diabetic foot patients. The study will evaluate the potential of OPM cells to improve critical limb ischemia (CLI) and promote wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nStudy Overall Design： The trial is designed to last up to 26 weeks, including a screening period of 1 week, a treatment period of 1 week, and an observation period of 24 weeks.\n\nAccording to the inclusion criteria, 10 diabetic patients with ulcers will be clinically screened, and after signing the informed consent form, they will be assigned a number. Before treatment, measurements will be taken of the size of the ulcer wound, the immune cell count of the ulcer exudate, and vascular CTA detection, among others, and recorded.\n\nOn day 0, a clean and tidy single room will be arranged as the treatment room. Venous blood will be drawn from each participant sequentially, 200ml per participant, and then cultured in the cell laboratory for 4 days according to their assigned numbers. On day 4, samples will be taken for endotoxin, bacterial and mycoplasma testing, cell counting, and flow cytometry analysis. Once approved, OPM cells will be collected and suspended in 5% human serum albumin. The harvested OPM cells will be stored at 2\\~8°C and transported to the hospital. Upon arrival at Shanghai Oriental Hospital, sample testing will be conducted first. Only after the samples pass testing will the patients receive intramuscular injections. The OPM cells must be injected into the muscle around the ulcer within 6 hours after leaving the laboratory.\n\nWound assessments will be conducted weekly after injection. Physical examinations and vital signs (pulse, blood pressure) will be recorded at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Clinical tests (blood routine, tumor markers, etc.) will be performed at week 12. Vascular CTA and immune cell count in wound lavage fluid will be detected at week 24 after cell intervention, and a final examination will be conducted at week 24.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of OPM cells in treating diabetic ulcer patients will be determined based on the healing of the wound size, the increase in the number of immune cells in the wound lavage fluid, and the increase in vascular collateral circulation.", "phase": "EARLY_PHASE1", "condition": "Diabetic Foot Ulcer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["： As a clinical study initiated by researchers, this study aims to explore the safety and preliminary efficacy of OPM cells in reducing complications in diabetic foot patients", "the safety and preliminary efficacy of OPM cells in the treatment of diabetic ulcers", "OPM cells in the treatment of diabetic ulcers"]}

They can be responsible for chronic and/or menstrual pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding. The first-line management of these conditions relies on medical treatment. Hormonal treatment with contraceptive pill can be effective, although up to 30% of patients do not respond to this line of treatment. In this context, GnRH antagonists have been introduced. By suppressing ovulation, they inhibit the action of the gonadal axis and thus can reduce bleeding and pain associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis. More recently, the GnRH antagonist known as Relugolix has been associated with a low-dose oestradiol and progesteron-line molecule, a medication known as Ryeqo. The goal of this type of treatment is to suppress ovulation while also minimizing symptôms which may derive from lack of oestrogen and progesterone in reproductive age women.\n\nWhile Ryeqo's efficacy has been proven by multiple large randomized controlled trials, its impact on blood coagulation has yet to be determined. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the main, potentially fatal, dleterious effect of oestrogen-containing hormonal treatmen, such as combined oral contraceptives (COC). Several epidemiological studies have found a 3-6 increase in the risk of VTE among women on COC. The thrombogenic risk can be assessed by measuring specific blood biomarkers, which are known to be correlated to the thrombogenic phenotype and allow an overview of the VTE risk prior to conducting large population-scale studies directly measuring the adverse event's prevalence.\n\nThe aim of this study is to document the effects of Ryeqo® on hemostasis parameters in order to estimate the risk of VTE associated with its employ. An improved understanding of the VTE risk associated with Ryeqo® will allow to adapt hormonal treatment based on each woman's personal risk profile.\n\nThe study will be explained to all women whose medical condition allows the prescription of Ryeqo. All women who give their consent to participate in the study will have a urinary pregnancy test and a blood sample drawn before beginning treatment with Ryeqo.

{"nct_id": "NCT03158441", "title": "DTi Diffusion Findings in Breast MRI Screening and Diagnostic", "brief_summary": "Introduction The most common breast cancer originates within the breast milk ducts, and is called ductal carcinoma. After the stage where the cancer is found only within the ducts, it invades the breast tissue beyond the ducts, and becomes invasive cancer (Infiltrating Duct Carcinoma). Breast cancer located within the ducts is called intra ductal carcinoma in situ- DCIS. DCIS is the developing cancer and usually does not metastasize. Another type of breast cancer originates within the breast lobules and is call lobular carcinoma.\n\nRecently at the Weizmann Institute, Prof. Hadassa Degani and her group developed and imaging technique using breast MRI. This technique allows to map the three-dimensional structure of the milk ducts in the breast. The method is based on measuring the random movement (Brownian motion) of water molecules (diffusion) in different directions in the breast tissue, collecting diffusion images by using magnetic field gradients in different directions, allowing imaging of Diffusion tensor Imaging -DTI. Movement of water molecules within a unified solution is usually random and uniform in all directions, but the internal structures in biological systems (such as cells, pipelines, fiber) restrict the movement of water in certain directions. The DTI method exploits this feature by measuring the diffusion in various directions, thus enabling calculating images of biological structures \\[1\\]. This method was proved to be effective in mapping the brain's white matter fibers and is used routinely in clinical tests used to monitor neurological injuries \\[2-4\\]. This method was used for milk ducts mapping within breast tissue at the Weizmann Institute. The system that was developed at the Weizmann Institute, showed that the movement of water molecules along the milk ducts is faster than their movement across the ducts and therefore it was possible using this method to map the breast ductal system. Also this method showed that it is possible to detect and diagnose malignant changes within breast and to distinguish them from normal tissue and benign tumors using DTI. Changes in cell density and arrangement causes changes in the directional diffusion coefficients and the differences between them \\[5-9\\] Research Plan Summary A prospective preliminary study to evaluate the correlation between the DTI analysis of breast MRI and the results of conventional contrast enhanced breast MRI.\n\nThe patients enrolled for the study will be women scheduled for breast MRI due to high risk screening or pretreatment evaluation. The patients will fill in a form regarding: age, hormonal status, risk factors, prior breast surgery or treatment (a form which is routinely filled out in our institution). They will then undergo a breast MRI scan, using the routine protocol in our institution. This will be directly followed by a DTI sequence, which takes about 10 minutes in addition to the regular examination. The DTI sequence is routinely used in other imaging institutions, as part of the breast MRI protocol.\n\nThe exams will be read on our regular work stations, and in addition will be analyzed by software developed at the Weizmann Institute. Both interpretations will then be compared to each other and to clinical and pathological data", "phase": null, "condition": "Breast Cancer", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["the correlation between the DTI analysis of breast MRI and the results of conventional contrast enhanced breast MRI"]}

In mainland China, approximately 169,000 females are diagnosed with breast cancer every year and constitute 12.25% of the breast cancer incidents worldwide. Additionally, 30% of early breast cancer turns metastatic, which is often incurable. Different from women with early breast cancer, women with metastatic breast cancer(MBC)must receive lifelong treatment, experience higher levels of emotional/physical distress, and feel frequent uncertainty about their health/possible death. They are also challenged to manage distressing adverse effects induced by different adjuvant treatments and experience heavy self-care demands during the transition period from being a patient to being a survivor. Thus, specific interventions to help women with metastatic breast cancer to recover from this traumatic event have been designed, and one of these is supportive-expressive group therapy(SEGT).SEGT has been found to achieve improvement in anxiety, depression, quality of life (QoL), family functioning, and satisfaction with treatment. However, the effect of SEGT on survival is inconsistent. Initial studies examining SEGT have reported a mean survival advantage of 18 months, however, these findings could not later be replicated.Yet, no study has reported a survival disadvantage for those given SEGT. In addition, we found no published articles on the application of SEGT among women with MBC in China. Owing to this dearth of previous research, it is unclear whether this therapy would exhibit positive effects within Chinese culture. Thus, we developed a \"Be Resilient to Breast Cancer\"(BRBC) program that is culturally tailored for Chinese females with MBC. This program was adapted from SEGT and is designed to increase resilience(defined as the capacity to bounce back after encountering a traumatic event) and QoL, decrease emotional and physical distress(allostatic load), and eventually prolong longevity. To better adapt to Chinese culture, we added education hosted by professional staff (e.g., clinical psychologists, dietician, Chinese medicine practitioner, etc.)in an effort to foster self-efficacy to combat symptoms (such as pain, fatigue, intrusive thoughts, etc.) through knowledge and technics (such as breath control, meditation, etc.),and to help patients gain a sense of control in their life. Second, trained mentors, who were breast cancer survivors themselves, were added to the group discussion to create non-hierarchical, reciprocal relationships through the sharing of experiences with those facing similar challenges. These mentors also provided women with first-hand information about treatment and offered suggestions to combat barriers to recovery.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Metastatic Breastcancer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

The lymphoma has come back or has not gone away after treatment. This is a research study using special immune system cells called TGFb-resistant LMP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (DNR-CTL), a new experimental therapy.\n\nSome patients with Lymphoma show signs of infection with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) before or at the time of their Lymphoma diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to 1/2 the patients with Lymphoma, suggesting it may play a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape being killed by releasing a substance called Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFb). The investigators want to see if special white blood cells (called T cells) that have been given a gene that they hope will let them survive against TGFb and that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can also survive in the blood and kill the tumor.\n\nInvestigators have used this sort of therapy with specially trained T cells to treat a different type of cancer that occurs after bone marrow and solid organ transplant called post transplant lymphoma. In this type of cancer they were able to successfully prevent and treat post transplant lymphoma. However when they used a similar approach in HD some patients had a partial response to this therapy, but no patients had a complete response. In a follow-up study they tried to find out if they could improve this treatment by growing T cells that recognize 2 of the proteins expressed on Lymphoma cells called LMP-1 and LMP2a. These special T cells were called LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). Although some patients had tumor responses, CTL therapy alone did not cure those who had a lot of disease. Investigators think that a reason for this is that the tumor cells are releasing TGFb. For this reason, they want to find out if they can make the CTL resistant to TGFb by putting in a new gene called TGFb resistance gene.

Increasing caloric intake fails to consistently restore lean tissue patients with HIV associated weight loss. Megestrol acetate has been shown to stimulate appetite and weight gain in subjects with cancer and in those with HIV associated weight loss. However, the weight gained during treatment with megestrol acetate was predominantly or exclusively fat. An important factor is the preferential increase in body fat seen in both of these studies may have been due to hypogonadism that occurs as a result of treatment with megestrol acetate, a progestational agent. Hypogonadism is associated with an increase in body fat and a decrease in LBM.

Primary end-point of the study is defined as the occurrence of burst abdomen during immediate postoperative period or incisional hernia over 2 year postoperative follow-up. Assessment of the association between the type of surgical technique and development of hernia will be based on comparison of mass (1 layer) continuous suture and layered (2 layers) continuous suture using slowly absorbable material and applying suture to wound length ratio of more than 4. Type of the utilized surgical technique will be based on randomization. The method of abdominal closure will remain unknown for patients and investigators assessing the presence of incisional hernias. Assessment of overall collagen content and type I to type III ratio will be performed by obtaining a fragment of tissue during operation, preparation of formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded blocks, cutting of 4-micrometer thick sections, staining with picrosirius red and immunohistochemical procedures. Images will be analyzed with dedicated computer software. Accumulation of advanced glycation end products will be evaluated indirectly by measuring skin autofluorescence utilizing a method based on the use of photodiodes.

{"nct_id": "NCT06949254", "title": "PRospective Observational Study of STereotactic Body rAdiation Therapy With Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Organ-confined High-risk Prostate Cancer: the PROSTAR Trial", "brief_summary": "Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second most common malignancy and the 5th common cause of cancer-related mortality in men worldwide. The majority of patients with PCa is diagnosed with potentially curable disease and its management includes different approaches, such as surgery, Radiation Therapy (RT) and Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT), for exclusive use or in combination each other. Randomized clinical trials have shown that moderate hypofractionated RT (i.e., 2.5-4 Gy per fraction) has become a valid alternative to conventionally fractionated RT in patients with PCa. The rationale of hypofractionation is based on the strong radiobiological evidence of the low α/β ratio of PCa cells (1.5-2 Gy) and the greater sensitivity to high dose per fraction. Data suggests that prostate Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an alternative treatment strategy for localized PCa with promising results in terms of disease control and toxicity, not inferior to conventionally fractionated RT. A systematic review of over 6000 men underwent prostate SBRT on prospective studies has demonstrated that this treatment provides favorable patient's quality of life, excellent disease control, and results in minimal serious acute or late toxicity.\n\nAlmost all the published studies, investigated the role of SBRT for organ-confined low- and intermediate favorable-risk disease. However, the HYPO-RT-PC trial addressed the role of SBRT in the context of unfavorable localized PCa. In this non-inferiority, phase III multicenter trial 1200 patients with either intermediate or high risk PCa were enrolled. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that SBRT (42.7 Gy in 7 fractions, 3 days per week, for 2.5 weeks) is non-inferior to conventional fractionation (78 Gy in 39 fractions, 5 days per week for 8 weeks) regarding failure-free survival, without significant differences in late normal tissues complications. Failure-free survival at 5 years was 84% in both treatment arms; adjusted HR was 1.002, hence ultra-hypofractionation was found to be non-inferior to conventional fractionated RT (given HR limit = 1.338). These results paved the way for the use of SBRT even in patients with unfavorable PCa. One controversial issue is the role of ADT in the setting of SBRT for localized PCa: in conventionally fractionated schedules, short term (4-6 months) and long term (1.5-3 years) ADT are considered the standard of care for unfavorable intermediate and high-risk PCa, respectively. However, in a systematic review/meta-analysis no benefit was found for ADT added to SBRT and similar results were reported also by King et al. in a retrospective study on over 1000 patients. The PACE C trial is one of three cohort of PACE that is multicenter, international phase 3 randomized controlled study. PACE C is set to explore the efficacy of SBRT in combination with ADT for patients with unfavorable intermediate and high-risk PCa and will recruit 1182 patients who will be randomized to receive either hypofractionated RT (60 Gy in 20 fractions) or SBRT delivered with 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions.\n\nIn this scenario, our study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions every other day) coupled with ADT (relugolix 18-24 monthsaccording to clinical care) in patients with localized high-risk PCa.", "phase": null, "condition": "High Risk Prostate Cancer", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["of the study was to demonstrate that SBRT (42", "the safety and efficacy of SBRT (40 Gy in 5 fractions every other day) coupled with ADT (relugolix 18-24 monthsaccording to clinical care) in patients with localized high-risk PCa", "SBRT in combination with ADT for patients with unfavorable intermediate and high-risk PCa and will recruit 1182 patients who will be randomized to receive either hypofractionated RT (60 Gy in 20 fractions) or SBRT delivered with 36"]}

Although up to 20% of patients with PCNSL are 80 years of age or older, little data exist with regard to optimal treatment of this patient population and they often do not qualify for clinical trials. In addition, elderly patients have a poorer rate of complete and partial response and increased risk of toxicity when treated with standard chemotherapy regimens.

Anti-CD20 therapy may not be required for all patients. The investigators hypothesis is that it may be better to give anti-CD20 therapy (obinutuzumab) only to patients that still have detectable cancer in their blood (minimal residual disease \\[MRD\\]) after being treated with a combination of two oral medications, zanubrutinib (a BTKi ) and venetoclax (a BCL-2i), instead of giving a combination of three drugs to all patients from the start of treatment. This strategy, if effective, will prevent overtreatment with anti-CD20 antibodies; reduce side effects of treatment while potentially increasing MRD negativity rates; and will possibly make the anti-CD20 antibody therapy more effective given the low tumor burden present when utilized. This study will test this hypothesis by treating subjects with 3 cycles of a zanubrutinib monotherapy lead-in, in order to debulk and mitigate tumor lysis risk, followed by 13 cycles of zanubrutinib and venetoclax combination therapy. Subjects who are both peripheral blood and bone marrow MRD negative at the completion of the 13 cycles of combination therapy will stop treatment and enter an observation phase every 3 months.

{"nct_id": "NCT05019196", "title": "fMRI Study of Functional Reorganization in Glioma Patients", "brief_summary": "Glioma is an invasive growth, easy to relapse, poor prognosis, great harm to human and society. Studies have shown that gliomas can cause the dynamic reorganization of brain functional areas, affecting the accuracy of surgical resection and the evaluation of long-term efficacy. While, it is difficult to monitor the functional reorganization of glioma in existing studies. The development trend can not effectively predict the outcome of tumor anaplasia and the compensation of brain function, which restricts the accurate tumor resection. In the early stage of this study, functional connectivity analysis was carried out of gliomas in the motor region and showed that the damage of motor functional connectivity on the opposite side of the lesion occurred earlier than that on the same side, suggesting that there may be some rules of how the disease caused functional reorganization. After stroke, the language and motor function will undergo plasticity, causing the functional areas to slowly repair the damaged function. Contrast to stroke, low-grade glioma grows slower, which gives brain more time to adapt to the damage caused by tumor growth, it may cause more functional reorganization. Professor Hugues Duffau's research showed that it is brain plasticity that can effectively explain patients with low-grade gliomas, even in language and motor areas, did not appear obvious dysfunction. Our previous research found there were significant differences in motor functional connectivity between the two hemispheres of the patients between the plasma tumor group and healthy controls. In addition, in the tumor group, the damage of motor connection on the contralateral side of the lesion occurred before on the ipsilateral side. These results suggest that brain function has been remodeled in patients with brain tumors who have not yet exhibited motor impairment. We presume there may be a certain pattern of brain function reorganization caused by low-grade glioma.

This will combine current therapy with innovative neuroimaging technologies to obtain data in humans that has hitherto only been available in animal studies. Data supporting the role of inflammatory molecules in sickness behaviours and other cognitive disorders are increasingly compelling. A putative mechanism linking inflammatory proteins to sickness behaviour is Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-driven increases in extracellular glutamate leading to changes in neural function and brain network integrity and ultimately to sickness behaviour. Investigators hypothesise that TNF antagonism will effect changes in brain network connectivity and sickness behaviour score, that Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients will show changes in brain network connectivity and glutamate quantification in the brain and that RA patients will show changes in monocyte infiltration into the brain that are correlated with changes in sickness behaviours. This is a randomised, placebo-controlled waiting list study. All patients will be eligible for anti-TNF treatment i.e. moderate to severe active disease as defined by Physician.

With the development of drugs with specific therapeutic targets, the clinical need for re-biopsy or even repeated biopsies is increasing; these biopsies are necessary to identify the mechanisms of drug resistance in the target lesions. Very often, lung cancer presents with small lesions and/or lesions located in areas that are difficult to reach with traditional biopsy techniques.\n\nAn alternative way to obtain genetic material is to isolate extracellular vesicles (EVs). These are secreted by almost all cell types, transport bioactive molecules, including nucleic acids (RNA and DNA), enclosed in a double lipid layer, and act as essential mediators in cell-cell communication. EVs are an ideal biomarker for cancer, as the content of EVs originating from tumor cells reflects the molecular and genetic composition of the parent cells. Long-stranded, concentrated EV-DNA is easy to amplify, making it a suitable candidate for NGS analysis. EVs are widely distributed in various body fluids, making them easier to sample using less invasive methods than tumor cells.\n\nRecent studies have shown that EVs successfully isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of lung cancer patients contain abundant amounts of dsDNA. In a study of patients with anatomopathologically confirmed NSCLC, the sensitivity and specificity of EGFR genotyping based on BAL EVs were high, and this test showed an even better mutation detection rate than tissue/cytology-based typing.\n\nConsidering the high positive predictive value of EV genotyping in bronchoalveolar lavage, this study aims to evaluate its feasibility in NGS analyses.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to determine the technical feasibility of NGS analysis on EV-DNA/RNA derived from bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with advanced NSCLC.\n\nThe secondary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of NGS analysis of EV-DNA/RNA derived from bronchoalveolar lavage compared to NGS analysis conducted on bronchoscopic cytological samples in patients with advanced NSCLC.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Non Small Cell Lung Cancer NSCLC", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["of identifying driver gene mutations that may be targeted by specific therapies", "its feasibility in NGS analyses", "the technical feasibility of NGS analysis on EV-DNA/RNA derived from bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with advanced NSCLC"]}

The investigator will first characterize in an already annotated cohort of 120 post-MPN AML homogeneous patients subgroups using comprehensive multiomic analyses. Dysregulated pathways will be identified in each subgroup using the omics data and single-cell RNA-sequencing will be performed in a subset of patients in each subgroup. A customised drug-panel will be derived from the dysregulated pathway for an ex vivo drug screening, which will use a flow-cytometry read-out enabling to identity drug effect on cells survival, differentiation, and stemness. The 3 most promising drugs will be validated in a preclinical in vivo model of patient's derived xenograft (PDX) and their impact on clonal architecture will be studied in primary cell cultures using single-cell DNA-sequencing.\n\nOverall, this proposal may provide a better understanding of MPN leukemic transformation mechanisms and provide a path for personalized therapies.

Recently, the investigators found that the serum level of soluble DcR3 was higher in SLE patients than in healthy control subjects (unpublished data). Taken together, the investigators propose that in autoimmune diseases, such as RA and SLE, activated T cells secrete more DcR3 than non-autoimmune controls, which may, in turn, costimulate T cells further and cause dysregulated lymphocyte activation. With the aim to establish the possible correlation between DcR3 genetic polymorphisms, DcR3 expressions, and autoimmune phenotypes, the investigators offer this proposal.

Achieving resectablity rates in previously unresectable patients has been defined as study endpoint among other well known primary and secondary objectives. Curing metastatic colorectal cancer is most likely in resectable patients and therefore the logical next step after completion of chemotherapy combination studies (e.g. EORTC 40983) is the addition of targeted agents. Bevacizumab has the most valid data of improving outcome figures and was therefore chosen as additional agent. Safety of the combination with Xelox was demonstrated in the investigators pilot trial (Gruenberger JCO 2006, ASCO 2006, WCGC 2006, ESMO 2006), consequently response rate and resection rate will be the primary endpoints in this trial.\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES\n\nPrimary Objective The primary objective of this study is the Resectability (R0) rate after neoadjuvant Bevacizumab in potentially resectable mCRC.\n\nSecondary Objectives The secondary objectives of this study include\n\n* Feasibility with regards to GI bleeding and wound healing complications after surgery of liver metastases\n* General safety\n* Overall Response Rate (ORR)\n* Recurrence Free Survival (RFS)\n* Overall Survival (OS)\n\nSTUDY DURATION Recruitment is planned for 12 months.

ADCs are a substance made up of a monoclonal antibody chemically linked to a drug. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight infections and other possible harms to the body. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain types of cells, including cancer cells. The linked drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Researchers think BV may be an effective treatment for this type of cancer because the drug targets cells that have CD30, which play a role in cancer cell growth. By destroying these cells, BV may help slow or stop the growth of the cancer. AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) is a treatment regimen that works by stopping the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

VTE is a chronic disease with a considerable risk of recurrence. Patients with unprovoked VTE, i.e. VTE in the absence of a temporary risk factor including surgery, cancer or immobilisation, have a high recurrence risk and indefinite anticoagulation is generally recommended. The recurrence risk of patients with VTE provoked by a transient risk factor is regarded as low. Discontinuation of anticoagulation after three months is recommended because the benefit of reducing the recurrence risk further by prolonged anticoagulation is outweighed by the bleeding risk. However, the newer direct oral anticoagulants are potentially associated with a lower bleeding risk than vitamin K antagonists. Because they are also meanwhile widely available and are convenient there is a trend towards prolonging anticoagulation also in patients with a VTE after a transient provoking factor. However, the definition of transient provoking factors is imprecise and a distinct categorization according to the risk of recurrence is lacking. Preliminary evidence suggests that the recurrence risk varies considerably between the different transient provoking factors. In a prospective cohort study, the investigators will include patients with a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism provoked by a transient risk factor defined according to Guidance of the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Kearon et al., J Thromb Haemost 2016; 14: 1480-3) after discontinuation of anticoagulation.

{"nct_id": "NCT04075162", "title": "Community Benefit of No-charge Calcium Score Screening Program", "brief_summary": "Current approaches in primary prevention for cardiovascular disease are based on probabilistic approaches to estimate risk, using many of the widely available cardiovascular risks scores, with over 100 such scoring systems currently available throughout the world. The rationale for this practice is to select those individuals at greatest risk for more intense targets, reduce risk of treatment to those at minimal risk, and to maximize the cost-effectiveness of treatment. A recent Cochrane Systematic Review assessed the practice of using risk scores to select individuals for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. 3 The principal finding of the systematic review was that there was little or no effect of providing clinicians with cardiovascular risk scores when compared to standard of care (5.4% versus 5.3%; relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence intervals 0.95 to 1.08). The authors concluded that there is major uncertainty whether current strategies for providing risk scores and called for further research to address this concern. Extent of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a strong risk marker for coronary events, with evidence mainly derived from observational studies and from prospective non-randomized studies. CAC, although endorsed for intermediate risk patients, is not widely adopted due to barriers in reimbursement. The cost of the test ranges between 100 and 300 USD in the United States, which may have limited the wide adoption of the test. Whether reducing the cost burden for CAC increases utilization for routine screening and its influence on physician practices and downstream testing is largely unknown. University Hospitals started offering low charge CAC (99$) since 2014. In 2017, University Hospitals started offering CAC for no charge for patients to improve access to this test, which has not traditionally been covered by insurance companies. The impact of no-charge CAC has never been studied.", "phase": null, "condition": "Cardiovascular Risk Factor", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

An acute episode that triggers a visit to the emergency department may be related to the progression of the disease, or to complications of treatment. The management of these patients is often complex and requires a degree of expertise. Emergency departments specialising in the management of cancer complications have been set up, and now deal exclusively with patients treated at their centres. However, for geographical or logistical reasons, patients with cancer are likely to consult a non-specialist emergency department and/or one located outside the cancer care centre. In this case, the emergency doctor may not have access to the oncology file, and care in the emergency department and downstream services may be sub-optimal. Studies have shown a positive impact on the quality of care and prognosis of patients thanks to the cancer centre's expertise. However, the effect of the centre on a cancer patient who visits the emergency department has never been studied.

A diagnosis carries with it a median survival of approximately 12 months, with 90 - 95% of patients surviving less than 2 years. The current standard treatment of surgical resection followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy has not substantially prolonged survival and even the few treatment options shown to exhibit small increases in survival primarily benefit certain (i.e., young) patient subpopulations.\n\nCancer vaccines represent one novel therapy for malignant gliomas. The goal is for the body to recognize the tumor cells as foreign and produce its own response to fight off recurring tumor cells. A promising means of causing an immune response so the body can create this immunity is through the use of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines.\n\nDendritic cells are a small group of cells contained in everyone's white blood cell population. These cells are responsible for letting the immune system know that something foreign, like bacteria, or a tumor, is in the body. Dendritic cells help the body ward off disease by alerting the immune system.\n\ngliadel is an FDA - approved drug - a wafer containing a concentrated amount of a chemotherapy agent. These wafers are placed into the brain cavity after the tumor is resected (removed) and deliver a steady amount of immediate chemotherapy medicine to the surrounding brain tissue. Also, since Gliadel is a local chemotherapy, it will prevent the detrimental suppression (weakening) of the immune system shown with systemic (throughout the body) chemotherapy.\n\nIn prior Phase l and phase ll studies, patients who received chemotherapy following Dendritic cells demonstrated longer progression free and overall survival than the patients who received Dendritic cells or chemotherapy alone.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether after standard therapy of tumor resection surgery, along with placement of Gliadel wafers at time of surgery followed by dendritic cell vaccines will not only generate (start) an immune response, but will provide longer progression free survival.\n\nPatients who were screened and not enrolled in this clinical trial due to screen failure will be notified of the reason for screen failure. Pre HIV counseling and appropriate referral resources will be provided. If the screen failure is due to the positive HIV test, appropriate post HIV counseling will be provided and appropriate referrals will be made.

Stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) has the advantages of precise positioning, relatively concentrated dosage, shorter course, and lower toxicity. Several studies could effectively protect cognitive function and achieve better tumor control rate. Currently, it has gradually replaced WBRT as standard local treatment choice for brain metastases. SRT includes Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Fractional Stereotactic Radiotherapy (fSRT). With the continuous updating of domestic radiation therapy equipment, the use of high-resolution multi leaf gratings enables the accuracy of fSRT based on linear accelerators to reach 0.5mm or even lower levels, and has gradually become one of the main choices for local treatment of a limited number of patients with brain metastases.\n\nHowever, there is currently no prospective randomized controlled study data analyzing the clinical benefits of different segmentation and dosages of SRT. In retrospective data comparing different segmentation schemes, researchers found that higher BED was associated with better local control. However, the ASTRO guidelines recommend relatively conservative doses for SRT of brain metastases, especially as the lesion volume increases, and the recommended dose of BED10 for SRT was only 48 Gy (30 Gy/5 Fx). This is based on the consideration that higher radiation exposure will bring a higher risk of radiation-induced brain necrosis. However, with the continuous updates of SRT treatment equipment and technology, existing technologies can achieve higher dose coverage for more brain metastases while meeting the normal tissue limit. Therefore, this study conducted a prospective intervention study to explore the feasibility and safety of optimizing SRT dosage based on normal tissue tolerance for the treatment of brain metastases, in order to further improve the therapeutic effect of intracranial lesions with brain metastases.\n\nThis study is designed as a single arm open prospective study, assuming that under this treatment regimen, the proportion of patients with lesion prescription dose BED10\\>50 Gy is 90%, and the incidence of radiation-induced brain necrosis within 1 year is 8.5%.

Radiotherapy remains a widely adopted non-invasive option, particularly for patients with bilateral disease or poor surgical candidacy. Traditionally, conventional fractionation schemes of 2.0-2.25 Gy per fraction over 6-7 weeks have been standard; however, emerging evidence supports the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) as an effective and more convenient alternative in this setting.\n\nThe unique anatomical confinement of early glottic tumors, along with their low propensity for lymphatic spread, makes them ideal candidates for dose escalation using hypofractionation. Several retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that higher doses per fraction (2.5-3.5 Gy) can yield comparable or superior local control rates compared to conventional regimens, without significantly increasing toxicity. The incorporation of modern techniques such as Intensity Modulated RadioTherapy (IMRT) and Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) has further.enabled safe and precise delivery of escalated doses to the primary lesion while sparing nearby organs-at-risk (OARs)\n\nRecent data have shown that a 3.5 Gy per fraction regimen (totaling 59.5 Gy in 17 fractions) achieves excellent tumor control with favorable toxicity profiles in selected patients. Additionally, omission of the posterior commissure from the elective target volume in the absence of direct tumor extension has been associated with reduced mucosal toxicity and improved patient-reported outcomes. Therefore,hypofractionated RT using 3.5 Gy per fraction offers a promising voice-preserving strategy in the treatment of early glottic cancer", "phase": null, "condition": "Early Glottic Cancer", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

Conventional Whole Brain radiotherapy(WBRT) was less effective, the stereotactic radiosurgery(SRS) technique had improve the local efficacy for 1-3 lesions, but the probability of intracranial recurrence was increased, Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy With Simultaneous Integrated Boost(SIB-IMRT) is a new radiotherapy technology, Giving a standard radiation dose of whole brain ,at the same time can boost the high-risk region in target, So that it can significantly shorten the treatment time, at the same time can improve the local control rate of brain metastases. In the aspect of normal tissue protecting, SIB was better than WBRT plus SRS sequential treatment pattern. 30Gy to the whole brain had a negative effects on cognitive function, the investigators previous study found that 25Gy to the whole brain while the tumor bed Simultaneous push to 50Gy was safe and effective, while reducing the impact on cognitive function. Hippocampus is a part of the brain located in the temporal lobe, Mainly responsible for long-term memory storage conversion and orientation. Many investigators point out that hippocampus is the main commander of neurocognitive function, Reduce the dose of hippocampus can significant improve the neurocognitive function. Temozolomide capsule is an anti-tumor alkylation agent for glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma. In recent years, some researchers find that Temozolomide capsules combine with radiotherapy such as SRS, WBRT or The two combined, can improve Objective response(OR) and prolong the Progress Free Survival(PFS),while with tolerable therapeutic toxicity.

{"nct_id": "NCT07199582", "title": "Association Between Obesity and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease", "brief_summary": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic disorder marked by heartburn and regurgitation, resulting from the reflux of gastric acid or bile into the esophagus. Chronic acid exposure leads to mucosal inflammation, erosive esophagitis, and Barrett's esophagus, conditions that increase the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Badreddine RJ et al., 2010; Fass R, 2022). Obesity, defined by the World Health Organization as a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², is recognized as a major global public health issue due to its rapidly rising prevalence and strong association with chronic disease. It is not only a cause of metabolic disorders but also a driver of systemic health complications (WHO, 2024). Obesity is linked with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, certain cancers, and sleep apnea.\n\nAdditionally, it negatively impacts psychological well-being, contributing to depression, low self-esteem, and social stigma (CDC, 2024). Evidence suggests a strong link between obesity and GERD. Studies demonstrate that obese individuals exhibit higher intra-gastric pressure, delayed esophageal transit, increased esophageal acid exposure, and a greater prevalence of defective lower esophageal sphincter function. These pathophysiological mechanisms contribute significantly to GERD development and its complications (de Vries DR et al., 2008; Cote-Daigneault J et al., 2014; Anggiansah R et al., 2013; Ayazi S et al., 2009). The rationale for this study is to explore the relationship between obesity and GERD, given the rising prevalence of obesity and its implications for gastrointestinal health. Diagnosis of GERD is primarily clinical, based on symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation. A trial of proton pump inhibitors for 4-8 weeks is recommended in patients without alarm features. Endoscopy is indicated for those with alarm signs or refractory disease, while pH monitoring is the gold standard in uncertain cases. Manometry is reserved for pre-surgical evaluation (Katz PO et al., 2022).To study the relationship between Obesity and GERD, given the rising prevalence of obesity and its potential impact on gastrointestinal health.", "phase": null, "condition": "Gastro Esophageal Reflux", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

Over a period of 18 months, ending in December 1994, 10,080 women were recruited into our study, after informed consent was obtained. At the initial recruitment visit, all women were administered a brief risk factor questionnaire, had 15ml of blood collected and, if sexually active, were given a pelvic examination. At the time of the pelvic examination, a Pap smear was collected, as were additional cervical cells which were then used for additional monolayer smears (ThinPrep) and for human papillomavirus and other testing. Pictures of the cervix, known as cervigrams, were also taken as a third screening test. Based on these screening tests, women were referred to colposcopy, at which time a more detailed risk factor questionnaire was administered, additional cervical cells and blood (15ml) were collected, and histological specimens were obtained, if indicated by the colposcopy. Women diagnosed with a high-grade cervical lesion (HSIL) or cervical cancer were treated by Social Security Administration clinicians using standard local protocols.\n\nWomen without evidence of HSIL or cancer at enrollment comprise the group of subjects who have been followed as part of our longitudinal study. Three distinct groups of women of approximately equal size (about 3,000 women each) exist within our longitudinal cohort. The first group consists of women who at enrollment had evidence of low-grade cervical lesions (LSIL) or equivocal lesions and a sample of the remaining cohort members. This group is being followed actively at 6-12 month intervals through their seventh anniversary in the cohort. The second group consists of women who were cytologically normal at enrollment but randomly selected for active follow-up. This second group will be seen once after enrollment, at their fifth anniversary in the cohort. Women in this group with evidence of LSIL at the fifth anniversary visit will be added to the first group described above and followed at 6-month intervals. The final group consists of the remaining women in our cohort (all cytologically normal at enrollment). These women are being followed passively via linkage to the cytology and tumor registries in Cost Rica.\n\nClinical visits conducted during follow-up consist of a brief personal interview that collects information on exposures since enrollment, the collection of 15ml blood, and a pelvic examination. Pap smear is prepared during the pelvic examination, and additional cervical specimens are collected and used to prepare a monolayer smear (ThinPrep) and for human papillomavirus and other testing. Similar to the enrollment visit, cervigrams are also collected from each participant at the time of their follow-up visits.\n\nDuring follow-up, women with any evidence of progression to HSIL or cancer (by Pap smear, ThinPrep, cervicography, or by visual inspection) are referred to colposcopy, censored from the study, and treated by Social Security Administration clinicians using standard local protocols.", "phase": null, "condition": "Cervical Neoplasia", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

This therapy involves vaccinations with special stimulator cells found in the human body called dendritic cells. These dendritic cells can take up proteins released from cancer cells and present pieces of these proteins to immune cells called T lymphocytes to create a strong stimulatory signal to fight the cancer.\n\nOne of these proteins is called telomerase, which is found on prostate cancers and is critically important for prostate cancer cells to grow. However, in most cancer patients, the immune system does not adequately destroy the tumor because the T cells are not stimulated sufficiently. T cells require strong stimulation before they grow and become active against cancer cells.\n\nWe have discovered that substances called ribonucleic acids (RNA), which carry the genetic instructions for the production of telomerase, can be used to overcome this problem and stimulate a strong immune response in cancer patients.\n\nIn order to test this hypothesis we have designed a clinical study and will enroll patients with metastatic prostate cancer expressing telomerase in order to determine whether or not this vaccine will stimulate T cells, which can recognize and kill prostate tumor cells.\n\nThe main objectives of this study are to find out whether injections with dendritic cells grown from blood cells and \"pulsed\" (mixed together for a short period of time) with RNA derived from the patient's own tumor are:\n\n1.

The objectives of the study described herein are to investigate the growth dynamics of uterine leiomyomas in a clinically relevant population of women. We will test the hypotheses that uterine leiomyomas are heterogeneous in terms of their growth characteristics and in their clinical symptoms or outcomes, and that differences in leiomyoma growth dynamics can be discriminated by molecular markers and cellular phenotypes. Participants will include 300 premenopausal women (greater than 18 years old) with at least one uterine leiomyoma. The inclusion criteria for patient enrollment is confirmed diagnosis of leiomyoma by ultrasound. At least one leiomyoma must be equal to or greater than 2 cm in diameter and the uterus must be enlarged to the size typical during the eigth week of pregnancy. After enrollment and informed consent, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans will be conducted beginning at the first visit and then at 3, 6, and 12 months. Each patient will have a physical exam, provide urine and blood samples at each MRI visit, and respond to an initial extensive telephone-administered questionnaire followed by abbreviated monthly questionnaire updates. A number of the enrolled women will require surgical intervention (hysterectomy/myomectomy) as standard care. If surgery is an outcome for women enrolled in the study, MRI will be conducted before surgery and the surgical pathologist will map uterine leiomyomas for comparison to MRI. Leiomyoma samples will be analyzed for histopathological and molecular changes correlated with growth. Because hysterectomy and myomectomy are common outcomes in women with leiomyomas, we anticipate tissue will be available from at least 100 of the 300 women in the study. For those women who opt for surgery, we will also administer a brief (less than 5 minute) questionnaire clarifying their reason for electing surgery. Upon completion of data collection, we will be able to compare leiomyoma growth as a function of multiplicity and location; examine the relationship between leiomyoma growth and clinical symptoms or outcome; identify molecular, cellular, and pathological characteristics of leiomyomas with differing growth dynamics; and examine endocrinological parameters and lifestyle factors related to differential growth dynamics of uterine leiomyomas.

The incidence rate double every 10 years. Fourteen thousand cases and 1700 deaths were reported in France in 2015.\n\nThe local staging of the cancer is represented by the Breslow index, which is measured on histological analysis, corresponding to the maximum depth of the cancer. Breslow index is a good pronostic value, and is used to choose for the best treatment for the patient.\n\nHaving access to the Breslow index before the first resection of the tumor would allow dermatologists to make a complete resection with the best treatment, and the analysis of the sentinel lymph node, all during the same surgical time. Currently, patients need 2 surgeries : one before the Breslow index, and a second one after.\n\nThe depth of cutaneous melanoma was already evaluated with High-Frequency Ultrasound (HF-US), but gave disappointing results, with Breslow index not being accurately measured.\n\nOnly 50% of tumors less than 2mm depth were efficiently measured. Results were even worst for bigger tumors.\n\nUltrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is a new approach, depending on the use of ultra high frequency and large-band transducer. Nice's CHU acquired the only ultrasound device capable of applying such ultra high frequency ultrasound (UHF-US) to human tissues. The device is a VEVO MD (Vevo MD, Toronto, Canada) and equip the Ultrasound Department since June 2018.\n\nThe images investigators can assess with this device have an axial resolution of 30µm, for a maximum emission frequency of 70MHz, which was not attainable until this day in human care.\n\nFurthermore, when compared to some of the mono-frequency devices investigators experimented before, this device allow investigators to attain a maximum depth of analysis up to 8mm.\n\nIn consequence, this device seems to be able to realize an extremely precise analysis of the skin, and of the cutaneous melanomas, for a structural analysis, as well as a precise depth measurement, and should be evaluated in the measurement of the Breslow Index.\n\nThe objective of the study is to analyze the interest of ultrasound biomicroscopy in the pre-therapeutic evaluation of the Breslow index of cutaneous melanoma, compared to histological findings.\n\nThe study will include 60 patients with cutaneous melanomas, recently diagnosed in the Dermatology Department of the Nice University Hospital (Pr Bahadoran, Pr Passeron, Pr Lacour).

Until today, official international guidelines for endoscopic screening in patients with ulcerative colitis advise to take 4 biopsies every 10 centimeters (with a minimum of 32) and of each suspected visible lesion. These guidelines are merely based on consensus during expert opinion meetings rather than evidence based. Recent studies have shown that chromo-endoscopy guided biopsies significantly reduced the number of biopsies for each procedure and detected more neoplastic lesions. Chromo-endoscopy is therefore considered the gold standard in this study in which we want to compare it to the performance and efficiency of new endoscopic imaging techniques.\n\nNarrow-Band Imaging (NBI) selectively uses certain wavelengths of the visible light leading to a shift in the excitation spectrum towards blue light. The first studies with NBI showed that the additional value of NBI in the detection of neoplastic lesions is comparable to chromo-endoscopy, but time saving and easier to perform. The Fujinon Intelligent Chromo-Endoscopy (FICE) system uses a similar theoretical principal as NBI but this is achieved via the use of post hoc computer algorithms, applying different filters to the stored endoscopic images and enabling a theoretically endless number of combinations of filters that can be used. The Pentax I-scan system also allows post hoc modification of the images. On the one hand, surface enhancement enables to better highlight mucosal changes. Spectral modification allows to apply different modes in analogy with to FICE system.\n\nThese new imaging techniques have a theoretical advantage which is extendedly used for sales purposes but has however so far not been proven in ulcerative colitis patients.

Investigators propose to develop and validate an optimized simultaneous PET/MRI protocol for local, regional and whole body preoperative staging in a single imaging session using the amino acid PET tracer, F-18 fluciclovine. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, the preoperative staging of men with prostate carcinoma (PCa) is currently problematic. Conventional imaging is falsely negative for regional lymph node metastases in a substantial fraction of men. In particular, approximately 35% of men with high-risk prostate cancer will have biochemical recurrence even after optimal surgical resection. A major benefit of simultaneous acquisition of a multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) and F-18 fluciclovine PET includes having the patient undergo a single imaging study which provides both anatomic and molecular characterization of the tumor, including metastases which would potentially be missed by conventional anatomic imaging and size criteria. Additionally, simultaneous acquisition will improve co-registration of the PET and MR data which is valuable for small lesions and in anatomically complex regions. Although the use of fluciclovine in the characterization of the primary PCa remains to be established, the anatomic detail provided by conventional mpMRI will complement the detection of small volume metastatic disease by fluciclovine PET. Additionally, the use of hybrid PET/MRI technology allows for the assessment of dynamic tracer uptake and washout during the whole body and regional PET/MRI scan, which may demonstrate the ability to increase detection of the primary PCa on fluciclovine PET. If F-18 fluciclovine PET/MRI can reliably and accurately detect nodal metastases in high-risk prostate cancer patients, surgeons may use this new technology to develop new treatment algorithms for the optimal management of these patients.", "phase": "PHASE1", "condition": "Prostate Cancer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

Radiotherapy, an essential treatment modality for HNC, can exacerbate malnutrition, potentially causing radiotherapy failure. Both domestic and international guidelines advocate early nutritional intervention for HNC patients at risk of malnutrition; however, specific recommendations on the type of nutritional treatment are lacking. Immunonutrition has shown promise in regulating the immune microenvironment, enhancing immune response, and reducing radiotherapy side effects compared to conventional nutritional interventions. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on immunonutritional therapy during the radiotherapy process for HNC in China. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of immunonutrition on nutritional status, immune function, and quality of life (QoL) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing radiotherapy.\n\nThis prospective interventional study enrolled 48 head and neck cancer (HNC) patients scheduled to undergo radiotherapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy). All participants received an immunonutrition formula supplemented with arginine, ω-3 fatty acids, and nucleotides. Throughout the radiotherapy course, certified dietitians and oncology nurses provided standardized nutritional guidance based on a five-step nutritional management protocol.

Thus, innovative approaches are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in WM. Chemotherapy-free approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Based on its high activity in WM and its low toxicity, Ibrutinib was approved for the treatment of WM by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, also Ibrutinib fails to induce CRs and the VGPR rate is 16% in relapsed patients. In addition, activity of Ibrutinib depends on the genotype: compared to MYD88mut/CXCR4WT patients Ibrutinib single agent therapy induces substantially lower response rates in patients with the MYD88mut/CXCR4mut or the MYD88WT/CXCR4WT genotype (major response (at least PR) in 91.7 % compared to 61.9 and 0 %, respectively). Phase II data have indicated that the proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib is able to overcome the inferior prognosis of Ibrutinib in MYD88mut/CXCR4mut and MYD88WT/CXCR4WT patients, as response rates were high for all genotypes in a phase II study combining Carfilzomib with Rituximab and Dexamethasone. Based on this the investigators hypothesize that addition of Carfilzomib to Ibrutinib will increase the VGPR/CR rate compared to Ibrutinib alone in patients with WM, in particular in patients carrying the CXCR4 mutation. In addition, the investigators hypothesize, that the combination Carfilzomib and Ibrutinib will be also highly active in MYD88 wildtype patients and that this combination will be at least as efficient in treatment naïve patients as in relapsed/refractory patients.", "phase": "PHASE2", "condition": "Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

Novel radiotracers and a genomic classifier (Decipher) will be used to guide treatment decisions, instead of standard imaging which is limited by lower sensitivity and specificity.\n\nThe hypothesis for the study is that treatment intensification based on a positive PSMA PET/ CT scan or Decipher high score (\\> 0.6) improves time to new metastases detected on PSMA PET/ CT in high-risk PCa. In patients who are PSMA PET/ CT negative with a low/ intermediate Decipher score (≤ 0.6), it is hypothesized that treatment de-intensification will improve patient quality of life while maintaining a good oncological outcome.\n\nThe study will be conducted at multiple centers across Europe. Participation in the study will comprise a screening period, where the screening assessments must be completed before subjects are enrolled and randomized (only for Phase 3 subjects). Eligible, consenting subjects will then undergo treatment according to their assigned study phase and treatment group, to occur over up to 96 weeks (24 months) with a post-treatment follow-up period to monitor safety and efficacy.

Patients who require a tunneled CVAD are some of the sickest patients we encounter and include oncology, hematology, and gastrointestinal (intestinal failure) patients. These patients are heavily reliant on their tunneled CVAD, which can be a lifeline for long-term administration of chemotherapeutics, IV medications, blood product transfusions, antibiotics, enteral nutrition, blood draws and fluids. Unfortunately, nearly 30% of pediatric external tunneled CVADs fail prior to the completion of treatment. External tunneled CVAD failures lead to unnecessary morbidity and mortality, interruption of medical therapy, and the added costs and risks associated with additional procedural complications. It is hypothesized that a newly designed securement method for external tunneled central venous access devices (CVAD) will reduce catheter-related complications and increase patient, parent and provider satisfaction, compared to the current standard of care, which is a clear transparent film dressing over the catheter exit site. A 20 patient, prospective clinical trial is proposed to address the following specific aims, which will determine if the securement device:\n\n1. Is rated by patients, parents and providers as easy to apply and comfortable for users\n2.

The occurrence of a parastomal herniation is high, with a reported incidence of 4-48%. Also, the former stoma site is at increased risk for the development of an incisional hernia. A clinical incisional hernia rate of 30% is reported after stoma reversal. Herniation can cause pain, deformity and possibly incarceration, which results in a significant impact on the quality of life of the patient.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that the use of a prophylactic mesh at the time of stoma formation leads to a lower incidence of incisional hernias after stoma reversal, an improved quality of life and therefore a possible cost reduction in healthcare.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo evaluate the incidence of incisional hernias after stoma reversal after preventive mesh placement compared to no mesh placement.

The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\n\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period.

{"nct_id": "NCT00166088", "title": "Effect of a Mediterranean Diet and Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Oxidative Stress and Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPC's)", "brief_summary": "Problem of Interest:\n\nA typical American diet that is high in an intake of fats (especially saturated fats and cholesterol) is known to lead to high blood levels of cholesterol, hardening of the arteries, and increases the risk of heart disease. The American Heart Association recommendations to follow a diet that is low in the amount of fat, and specifically cholesterol, that is eaten can improve blood levels of cholesterol but can lead to a high intake of sugars (especially processed sugars) that can lead to obesity and continued heart problems.\n\nStudies of people who eat a diet that is typical of the Mediterranean region have shown that this type of diet leads to reductions in heart disease as well as forms of cancer. A typical Mediterranean diet has a large amount of fruit, vegetables, whole grain breads and cereals, beans, potatoes and seeds. Olive oil is the main source of fat and there is a daily use of dairy products (such as cheese and yogurt) in low to moderate amounts. The main meats are fish or poultry with rare red meat. Desserts are usually fruits with rare sweets. Wine is also used in low to moderate amounts with meals.\n\nNo isolated aspect of the diet explains all of its benefits, but it is believed that the ingredient of the diet that most helps to reduce the risk of heart disease is the high amount of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fatty fish as well as in nuts and certain oils. Several studies of patients with either known heart disease or risk factors for heart disease have shown a reduction in heart disease events, such as heart attacks, as well as markers of heart disease risk when patients followed a Mediterranean diet. Other studies have shown that giving a supplement that contains omega-3 fatty acids to patients with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease also reduces heart disease events and markers of heart disease risk.\n\nIn this current study we, the investigators at Emory University, plan to compare the effects of following a Mediterranean diet versus continuing to follow an American type diet and supplementing parts of the Mediterranean diet, including omega-3 fatty acids, on markers of heart disease risk. A third group will continue to follow their usual diet without supplements to serve as a control.\n\nHow Problem Will be Studied:\n\nIn this initial study we will compare three groups. One group will receive one month of prepared meals that will follow a Mediterranean diet. This group will also receive extensive counseling and education on how to maintain a Mediterranean diet. During the second month of the study this group will be encouraged to continue following a Mediterranean diet by themselves with assistance from a nutritionist. The second group will be asked to continue on their current diet and receive supplements that are important parts of the Mediterranean diet. These supplements will include an omega-3 fatty acid capsule, walnuts and grape juice. A third group will be asked to continue their current diet and level of activity without supplements to serve as a control. We will follow the effects on markers of heart disease risk. We will also determine if patients are able to continue following a Mediterranean diet on their own or whether simply taking supplements is easier.\n\nAdvancement in Scientific Knowledge:\n\nThis study will advance scientific knowledge by comparing the effects of following a Mediterranean diet versus simply taking supplements of the believed to be important aspects of the Mediterranean diet. We will also be able to determine if it is easier to follow a Mediterranean diet or take supplements for patients who are currently ingesting a typical American diet.\n\nStandard of Care:\n\nCurrently the recommended diet for all Americans is a Step 1 American Heart Association diet that is low in fat and specifically low in saturated fats and cholesterol. As stated above, despite these recommendations, there is a growing problem of obesity in the United States and there is evidence to suggest that a Mediterranean diet may be better.", "phase": "PHASE2", "condition": "Obesity", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["if it is easier to follow a Mediterranean diet or take supplements for patients who are currently ingesting a typical American diet"]}

More than half of patients present with advanced or metastatic disease for which chemotherapy plays a very limited role. Therefore, development of another therapeutic approach is needed. Cancers in humans are commonly associated with mutations in dominant and recessive oncogenes. These genes produce mutated proteins that are unique to cancer cells. Von Hipple-Lindau (VHL) gene which is associated with the development of the VHL disease, has been recently mapped and cloned, and it is found to be mutated in 57% of sporadic renal cell carcinomas.\n\nData in mice have shown the generation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) that are capable of detecting endogenous cytoplasmic peptide derived from mutated oncogenes. In addition, we have recently demonstrated, by conducting different phase I clinical trials in which we vaccinate cancer patients with mutated Ras or p53 peptides corresponding to the abnormality patients harbor in their tumors, that in some patients we can generate immunological responses represented by the generation of lymphocytes (CD4+ and/or CD8+). In the current study, we would like to extend our observations to test whether VHL tumor suppressor protein can be immunologically targeted by vaccination. We have identified specific epitopes along the amino acid sequence of the VHL protein, which represent known specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-I binding motifs. These amino acids stretches in the VHL protein correspond to the area of the point mutation hot spots. Therefore, we propose to treat patients with sporadic RCC who carry VHL mutations in their tumors with corresponding mutant VHL peptide vaccination. This vaccination will be done either by using pulsed-autologous peripheral mononuclear cells with the peptides, or peptides administered subcutaneously alone or in combination with cytokines.", "phase": "PHASE2", "condition": "Renal Cell Carcinoma", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

A large number of studies have focused on AEs and medical errors in ICUs \\[2-6\\], one of their main goals being to identify strategies for preventing AEs and thereby improving patient outcomes. Choosing the best AE to serve as an indicator for the risk of medical error is challenging. In 2005, our group conducted a systematic literature review and presented the results to 30 national experts with clinical backgrounds in internal, emergency, and intensive care medicine. Using the Delphi technique, these experts selected 14 AEs that had the following characteristics: high frequency, easy and reproducible definition, association with morbidity and mortality, and ease of reporting without fear of punishment (Iatroref I study) (ref abstract). These AEs were used in a French multicenter study (75 ICUs) for a weeklong incidence evaluation (Iatroref II study) (ref abstract). Preliminary evaluation of the results allowed us to choose the following AEs for the current Iatroref III study: error in insulin administration, error in anticoagulant administration, error in anticoagulant prescription, unplanned extubation, and unplanned removal of central venous catheter. Evidence suggests that guidelines alone without reinforcing strategies may be insufficient to change provider behavior and that the most effective interventions may be multifaceted rather than single-component strategies (\\[7\\]).

{"nct_id": "NCT05207241", "title": "The Effect of Gravity on the Occurrence of Lactational Mastitis", "brief_summary": "Lactation is the instinct of almost all mammals, including human beings. With the development of human society, the function of lactation has gradually deviated from nature instinct. Breastfeeding related industries, such as milk bottles, formula and breast pumps, have formed a vast consumer market, leading to a transition from breastfeeding mothers' individual instinct to the social division of labor. Previous studies found that the incidence of lactational mastitis remains largely unchanged post World War II with some reporting an increase, suggesting the hazards of lactational mastitis still exist under the background of social division of labor. Breast milk contains ingredients that improve the immunity of newborns. By affecting mothers' breastfeeding, lactational mastitis pose a hazard for newborns, increasing the chances of developing respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. For breastfeeding mothers, severe mastitis may develop into breast abscess due to improper treatment in the early stage. In addition to antibiotic treatment, incision, drainage and even surgery may be required. These potentially increase the risk of developing postpartum depression, type II diabetes, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Compared with other mammals, humans and cows have a higher incidence of lactational mastitis, indicating that human intervention in breastfeeding may be the cause of the high incidence. On the other hand, as a result of walking upright, humans' hands are liberated, forming complex and diverse breastfeeding position. According to the Sakra World Hospital, these positions are classified into eight types: cradle, cross cradle, supine, football, Australian hold, inverted lateral, lateral cradle, and lateral. The pilot study demonstrated that different breastfeeding positions are closed related to the occurrence of lactational mastitis, and to the location of mastitis. Assuming that the baby's sucking factors remain the same, there must be differences in the milk drainage in different breastfeeding positions under the influence of gravity. Researchist speculate that breastfeeding women who opt to a position that cause an anti-gravitational expulsion of milk are more likely to develop lactational mastitis. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how the scientific guidance on the gravitationally assisted breastfeeding positions will reduce the occurrence of mastitis.", "phase": null, "condition": "Lactation Mastitis", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["to investigate how the scientific guidance on the gravitationally assisted breastfeeding positions will reduce the occurrence of mastitis"]}

{"nct_id": "NCT00342186", "title": "Genes Involved in Resistance or Susceptibility to Hepatitis B Virus", "brief_summary": "This study, conducted by the Beijing University First Hospital of China and the National Cancer (NCI), will try to identify genes associated with either susceptibility or resistance to chronic infection by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Some people recover from HBV infection; others become chronically infected and may go on to develop severe liver disease such as cirrhosis or liver cancer. About 350 million people worldwide have chronic HBV infection. Of 120 million infected Chinese, 90 percent of children infected at less than 5 years of age and 10 percent of infected adults develop persistent infection.\n\nHBV-infected and non-infected healthy persons of Han ethnicity born before 1963 may be eligible for this study. Offspring of infected candidates (born in any year) may also be enrolled. Infected adults must have at least one infected parent or sibling. Persons who resided in Fusui County of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region or in the Qidong district of Jiangsu Province for at least 6 months before 1986 may not participate.\n\nAll participants (except offspring of the study subjects) will fill out a health questionnaire (providing information about eating, drinking, and smoking habits and a personal and family health history) and will donate no more than 20 milliliters of blood. The blood will be tested for antibodies, antigens, and other substances that may indicate infection with hepatitis viruses. Some of the blood will be sent to the NCI for DNA analysis to identify genetic factors that may influence clearance of the hepatitis virus after infection or progression to liver diseases associated with HBV infection. Infected patients who have had a liver biopsy in the past will be asked permission to examine tissue from the biopsy and to review laboratory results of any tests done for diagnostic and treatment purposes.\n\nWhen the study is completed, specimens sent to the NCI will have identifiers linking the material to the donor removed. The anonymous samples may then be used for other genetic studies. Specimens remaining in China will continue to have identifiers linked to them and may be used for future studies designed to identify who is at greatest risk of developing serious liver diseases. Participants who do not want their blood used for future studies may request that the samples be destroyed.\n\nBecause children inherit one-half of their DNA from each parent, DNA samples from HBV infected study participants may provide additional information about the parent s DNA structure. Offspring who participate in this study will provide a DNA sample. The sample is obtained by swishing a mouthwash in the mouth for 30 seconds and then spitting the mouth wash into a cup. The DNA is then isolated from the mouth cells.", "phase": null, "condition": "Hepatitis, Viral, Human", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there are higher levels of VEGF in the tumors and blood of many women with metastatic breast cancer. VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral drug that has been shown to decrease production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299 administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. Safety studies in research animals indicate good tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable and will show evidence of VEGF reduction and antitumor activity when administered orally in combination with anastrozole (Arimidex®), letrozole (Femara®), or exemestane (Aromasin®) to women with metastatic breast cancer.", "phase": "PHASE1", "condition": "Metastatic Breast Cancer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

{"nct_id": "NCT01978483", "title": "Effect of RANKL Inhibition on UV-induced Immunosuppression", "brief_summary": "Ultraviolet (UV) light is part of normal sunlight and has many effects on human skin and health. One of the harmful effects of long-term UV light exposure is that it can cause skin cancer. The mechanism by which UV light causes skin cancer is not entirely understood. One of the ways UV light causes cancer is by modifying DNA molecules in the cells of the skin. Another mechanism involved in cancer formation by UV light is immunosuppression. By this mechanism, UV light inactivates cells of the immune system of the skin. The immune cells are responsible for the detection and destruction of foreign substances and organisms such as bacterias and viruses but they also recognize and destroy cancer cells. UV light is known to prevent cells of the immune system to destroy cancer cells.\n\nIn laboratory experiments, a medication called denosumab has been shown to diminish the inhibition of ultraviolet-induced suppression of skin immunity. In other words, this medication could block the effect of UV on cells of the immune system and might allow patients taking this drug to be better protected from skin cancer.\n\nThe objective of this study is to test whether denosumab blocks the immunosuppressive effect of UVB light in healthy subjects. This study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, ten subjects (Cohort 1) will be sensitized to diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), a topical sensitizer commonly used for the treatment of alopecia areata and cutaneous warts. By reexposing the subjects to DPCP in incremental doses, dose-response levels of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions in normal skin will be obtained. This will allow comparison of the normal levels of DPCP-induced cutaneous hypersensitivity (CHS) reaction in non UV-exposed skin (Cohort 1) to the CHS obtained from the two UVB-exposed experimental groups of Cohort 2.\n\nIn the second stage of the study, 20 subjects (Cohort 2) will be exposed to an immunosuppressive dose of ultraviolet B (UVB) 24 hours prior to DPCP sensitization. This is expected to result in the abolition of CHS upon rechallenge with DPCP. In order to assess whether denosumab can reverse UVB-induced immunosuppression, the subjects will have previously been randomized to receive a single 1mL injection of either 60 mg denosumab (group A; 10 subjects) or 1 mL saline (group B; 10 subjects) two weeks before UVB exposure.

Poor sleep quality can contribute to and perpetuate problems with daytime fatigue, pain, and distress that are common among patients with hematologic cancer. There is a need for behavioral interventions that address insomnia and daytime fatigue, pain, and distress once hematologic cancer patients have returned home after inpatient chemotherapy. Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI) is a new approach to treating insomnia. This group-based intervention combines sleep restriction and stimulus control with mindfulness principles and exercises to reduce worry and promote positive responses to insomnia. To date, MBTI has not been applied to patients with hematologic cancer. If MBTI is to meet the needs of hematologic cancer patients, it must be adapted in several ways. First, because hematologic cancer patients are immunosuppressed, MBTI needs to be adapted for one-to-one delivery. Second, because hematologic cancer patients experience significant daytime fatigue, pain, and distress, MBTI needs to be adapted to include systematic training in coping skills for these symptoms. The investigators propose to develop and pilot test an adapted MBTI (MBTI+) protocol for hematologic cancer patients reporting insomnia, fatigue, pain, and/or distress after inpatient chemotherapy. The study will be conducted in two phases. In Phase I, the study team will use focus groups with hematologic cancer patients and hematology-oncology providers to guide development along with user testing with hematologic cancer patients reporting insomnia and daytime symptoms of fatigue, pain, and/or distress.

It is a pediatric, multi-systemic disease, the main features of which are retinal vasculopathy and neurological disorders, associated with brain calcification and leukodystrophy. Its precise genetic etiology was discovered in 2012: autosomal recessive mutation of the CTC1 gene.\n\nPublications about this syndrome are very few, and consist only of case reports, or small series of cases. This is explained by the rarity of occurrence of this syndrome. Since 1988, 57 cases of Coats plus syndrome have been published, with case series of up to 13 patients. Only 28 cases were detailed concerning the precise clinical presentation in the literature.\n\nThe general characteristics of this syndrome are known and, in addition to the ophthalmological and neurological damage, the various publications have been able to report a digestive attack (hemorrhages), hematological damage (central cytopenias), or increased bone fragility. No treatment is currently available to cure patients.\n\nThe natural history of this disease is poorly known. However, the most accurate knowledge possible of this disease, and its natural history, is essential. It would allow an easier identification of this rare syndrome, the establishment of a management (monitoring and therapeutic) adapted, and a more accurate genetic counseling in case of need of a prenatal diagnosis.\n\nThe description of a new series of unpublished cases, as well as a comprehensive review of the literature on Coats plus syndrome, will provide a more comprehensive and informed view of this disease.\n\nMoreover, LCC syndrome (leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts) is an autosomal recessive disorder linked to a mutation in the SNORD118 gene, which has the particularity of presenting the same neurological (neuro-radiological and clinical) characteristics, but without associating the others. ophthalmological and systemic disorders.

It is advocated that patients with high-risk NMIBC receive an adjuvant course of intravesical Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as first-line treatment. However, a substantial proportion of patients will 'fail' BCG. Radical cystectomy remains the treatment of choice for NMIBC who have failed intravesical therapy, but there are situations when surgery is not feasible due to competing co-morbidities or a patient's desire for bladder preservation. For these patients, the potential options available are limited.\n\nIn MIBC, radiotherapy (RT) in association with chemotherapy, has been shown to produce 10-year overall survival rates comparable to those of radical cystectomy in selected cases. At the opposite, results from trials assessing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in patients with NMIBC are less documented and discordant.\n\nImmunotherapy with immune-checkpoint blockade therapies is increasing as an option and has shown very promising results for several cancers, including bladder carcinoma.\n\nAn established body of published work has shown that radiation enhances many of the steps needed for the generation of antigen-specific immune responses, including inflammatory tumor-cell death, dendritic cell activation, and antigen cross-presentation. Several groups have reported improved local control when checkpoint blockade immunotherapy is added to radiation in different tumor types. On the one hand, radiotherapy might stimulate the induction of local endogenous immune responses by anti-PD-1 treatment. On the other hand, active immune stimulation by anti-PD-1 treatment within the tumor microenvironment might maximize radiation-induced antitumor immunity.\n\nCombination immunoradiotherapy using PD-1/PD-L1 signaling blockade could therefore offer an interesting strategy in bladder tumors, especially as an optional bladder preservation treatment for BCG unresponsive NMIBC.\n\nThe originality of the therapeutic strategy is the use of radiation (local treatment) combined with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (systemic treatment). Radiotherapy might increase response rates by creating a more permissive tumor microenvironment through increasing PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and stimulating the accumulation and activation of CD8+ T cells.\n\nAvelumab seems to have a specific cytotoxic activity suggesting its interest in local control of the disease, especially in association with radiotherapy.", "phase": "PHASE2", "condition": "Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

There is a complex relationship between a malignant lesion and its micro-environment; a tumour does not exist in isolation but has a dynamic relationship with host cells. There is a growing interest in delineating the relationship between tumour manifestations and pain.\n\nBy retrospectively identifying individuals who have been referred to specialist pain clinics at a cancer centre and matching them to controls, the investigators can identify two groups of patients (those who experienced significant problems with pain and those who did not).

Only 10-15% of the patients will be candidates for curative resection. After response to chemotherapy this figure rises 10-13% more.

If the estimated RLV is insufficient preoperatively, portal venous embolization site (PVE) is performed for compensatory hypertrophy, thus increasing the number of resections 19%. Still, in 20% of these patients surgery can not be performed because RLV is not achieved or because the disease progresses while waiting for growth. Therefore, it is necessary to improve liver regeneration without promoting tumor growth. Studies on liver regeneration, have determined that cells (CD133 +) are involved in the liver hypertrophy that occurs after hepatectomy. CD133 + have been used to induce liver hypertrophy with encouraging results.

{"nct_id": "NCT03760354", "title": "Corticosteroid Treatment in the Acute Phase of Caustic Ingestion Management", "brief_summary": "The management of patients who have ingested a caustic product has changed since 2007. Whereas previously the lesion assessment and surgical indication were based on endoscopic data, the therapeutic algorithm is currently based solely on the results of a CT scan with contrast injection, performed 6 hours after ingestion. This examination makes it possible to reliably assess the viability of the esophageal and gastric walls and thus to indicate digestive resection. The therapeutic consequences of this new treatment are important because, by expanding the indications for conservative treatment after severe ingestion, it brings a significant gain in terms of survival, morbidity and functional outcome. In the absence of emergency digestive resection, however, the functional prognosis is often overshadowed by the formation of esophageal stenosis in the months following ingestion. Patients then require endoscopic dilation treatment. In the event of failure or impossibility of dilation, which defines refractory stenosis, esophageal reconstruction is necessary. In case of sequential pharyngeal stenosis following ingestion, esophageal and pharyngeal reconstruction is indicated as a first-line treatment, since these stenosis do not respond to endoscopic dilations. The expansion of the indications for conservative treatment after severe ingestion using CT scans has led to an increase in the incidence of after-effect stenosis.\n\nWe aim to develop a therapeutic approach that will prevent the development of refractory and pharyngeal esophageal stenosis. Indeed, there is currently no strategy that has proven effective in this regard in adults. The value of corticosteroid therapy for the prevention of caustic stenosis has only been evaluated in children and remains controversial.\n\nThe main objective is to evaluate the effect of early systemic corticosteroid therapy on the risk of refractory esophageal or pharyngeal stenosis within one year of ingestion of a caustic substance in a population of patients at high risk of stenosis, defined according to tomodensitometric criteria (grade IIb: severe lesions, absence of transparietal necrosis), and for whom there is no indication of urgent digestive resection.", "phase": "PHASE2", "condition": "Caustic Esophageal Injury", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["to develop a therapeutic approach that will prevent the development of refractory and pharyngeal esophageal stenosis", "the effect of early systemic corticosteroid therapy on the risk of refractory esophageal or pharyngeal stenosis within one year of ingestion of a caustic substance in a population of patients at high risk of stenosis, defined according to tomodensitometric criteria (grade IIb: severe lesions, absence of transparietal necrosis), and for whom there is no indication of urgent digestive resection"]}

The CHOP-R treatment is given as a standard of care for RS but has limited benefit - it is often temporary to extend life. Richter's Syndrome returns in most patients who then die from this disease. The STELLAR trial will investigate if a new drug called acalabrutinib, which is effective used by itself in patients with relapsed CLL and also some with Richter's Syndrome, will improve outcomes for newly diagnosed patients with RS. Acalabrutinib blocks a protein in CLL which can stop the cancer growing.\n\nParticipants who have Richter's Syndrome and are suitable for CHOP-R will be recruited by specialised hospitals across the UK. People with another cancer, heart problems, or recent stroke cannot take part. Participants will have a lymph node biopsy, 3-4 bone marrow biopsies, blood samples, and PET-CT and CT scans. CHOP-R is given in a hospital every three weeks up to 6 times. All participants will receive CHOP-R; half will also receive acalabrutinib. When treatment with CHOP-R ends the patients who had acalabrutinib can continue to take it; patients who had CHOP-R alone may have acalabrutinib if their Richter's Syndrome returns after CHOP-R.", "phase": "PHASE2", "condition": "Richter Syndrome", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["the effect of acalabrutinib taken in combination with CHOP-R compared to taking CHOP-R alone in patients with newly diagnosed Richter's Syndrome (RS)"]}

A large number of studies have shown that women's cervical, vaginal and perianal precancerous lesions, related cancers, condyloma acuminatum and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are closely related to HPV infection. Among them, the persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is closely related to the occurrence of invasive cervical cancer. Previous studies have shown that there are significant differences in the effects of multiple HPV infection and persistent infection of different types (such as type-16, -18, -39 and -52) on different levels of cervical lesions, and there is a certain correlation between HPV load in the process of persistent infection and the degree of cervical lesions. In addition, other studies have shown that HPV-16 viral load has certain clinical significance in predicting Cin2 / CIN3 high-grade cervical lesions, and HPV viral load level is significantly different in cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). The above biological changes such as HPV infection type, quantity and proportion can promote the occurrence and development of cervical precancerous lesions and related cancers to varying degrees.

Thus, an accurate risk stratification at the time of PCA diagnosis is crucial. The histological examination of PCA biopsy specimens could not accurately predict the final tumor aggressiveness shown on radical prostatectomy specimens because of heterogeneous distributions of the most malignant tumor cells. Prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has been generally accepted to be the best imaging modality for detecting and localizing prostate cancers themselves. Furthermore, the rapid development of radiomics provide comprehensive quantitative information of all tumor data which could be used for risk stratification and prognosis prediction. Thus, this study plans to enroll 200 eligible patients who undergo prostate mpMRI first, followed by radical prostatectomy for prostate cancers.

It is therefore critical to find new strategies to treat or reverse diabetes.\n\nOne such approach is adopting a healthy diet, which can dramatically improve blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes and even induce diabetes remission. Despite this, not much is known about which food groups are most effective at improving blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes.\n\nInterestingly, of the various food groups, epidemiologic data suggests that whole fruit may be one of the most efficacious at both preventing type 2 diabetes and improving blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, few clinical trials have investigated the effects of whole fruit on blood sugar control.

Labvax 3(22)-23 is designed to target a specific antigen (labyrinthin), which is a protein found on the surface of adenocarcinoma tumor cells. Labyrinthin is a protein that is not expressed on normal cells in the skin, lungs, salivary glands, pancreas, nor other tissues. In adenocarcinoma, the tumor cells produce too much labyrinthin causing them to express this protein on the surface of the tumor cells. One way to control the growth of these tumor cells is to teach the immune system to generate an immune response against the labyrinthin protein by vaccination against labyrinthin. GM-CSF, or sargramostim, is a protein that acts as a white blood cell growth factor. It has also been shown to stimulate immune system. Thus, administration of GM-CSF may help to boost the immune system response when given together with the vaccine. This study may improve the general knowledge about Labvax 3(22)-23 and how the body may generate an immune response to kill adenocarcinoma tumor cells.

{"nct_id": "NCT06777745", "title": "Model Supported Breast Examination Training for Midwifery Students", "brief_summary": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and early detection significantly improves treatment success. Screening methods used for early detection include breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography. It is critical for midwifery students to learn CCM and teach this method to women. CPM allows women to recognise early signs through breast self-examination. This method is simple and inexpensive and can be applied without requiring much time and labour. Practical training of midwifery students helps them to ensure the effectiveness and correct application of this method. The use of breast examination models during the training process gives students practical experience in detecting signs of breast cancer, such as nipple depression, discharge, asymmetry of the breasts and the appearance of orange peel. In addition, midwifery students can develop their clinical skills by having the opportunity to make mistakes and gain hands-on experience in a safe environment. This process can contribute to increasing early diagnosis rates and improving treatment processes.The sample of this pre-test, post-test, follow-up randomised controlled study consisted of 64 midwifery students (experimental=32, and control=32). Data will be collected with Personal Information Form (PIF), Breast Examination Skills Assessment Form (BESAF), Self-Confidence Scale (SC) and Student Satisfaction and Confidence in Learning Scale (SCSLS). After obtaining the consent of the students in the experimental group, pre-test data will be obtained by filling out the 'Personal Information Form', 'Self-Confidence Scale' and 'Student Satisfaction and Confidence in Learning Scale'. Then, theoretical information will be given and the examination stages such as determining the area to be examined, manual examination of the area, examination method, nipple examination and detection of malignant formations in the breast will be explained practically in the breast examination model in the laboratory environment. Students will be taken in groups of 10, and after the application is explained, each student will perform the breast examination and evaluation individually. Approximately 15 minutes will be allocated for each student. Two weeks after the breast model application, the same students will be taken to the laboratory and asked to perform all the examination steps again. While the students are performing the examination steps, the researcher will mark the complete and incomplete applications on the 'Breast Examination Skill Evaluation Form' and the missing steps will be explained to the students and they will be asked to complete them. At the same time, 'Self-confidence Scale' and 'Student Satisfaction and Confidence in Learning Scale' will be filled out for the post-test. Then, two weeks later, the 'Self-Confidence Scale' and 'Student Satisfaction and Confidence in Learning Scale' will be filled out again for the final post-test. After obtaining the consent of the students in the control group, pre-test data will be collected by applying 'Personal Information Form', 'Self-Confidence Scale' and 'Student Satisfaction and Confidence in Learning Scale' to the students. Then, the students will be given theoretical information and a video will be shown to them, which includes examination stages such as determining the area to be examined, manual examination of the area, examination method, nipple examination and detection of malignant formations in the breast.\n\nTwo weeks later, the students will be taken to the laboratory environment and will be asked to perform the application steps in line with the theoretical course they have taken.

Higher expression of interleukin-Ibeta(IL-1beta),IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and TNF-alpha were observed in epicardial adipose tissues in patients with CAD. These findings suggested that the pericoronary tissues could be a source of inflammatory mediators or act as paracrine that lead to vascular inflammation on CAD pathogenesis.

{"nct_id": "NCT03260881", "title": "Liraglutide Effects on Epicardial Fat Inflammatory Genes", "brief_summary": "Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the visceral fat of the heart. EAT could locally affect the coronary arteries through local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EAT plays a role in the development of the coronary artery disease (CAD). EAT is a highly enriched with genes involved in inflammation. Given its rapid metabolism and simple measurability, as first developed by Iacobellis, EAT serves as target for medications targeting the fat. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1A) are anti-diabetic medications with recently suggested cardio-protective properties. Liraglutide, a GLP-1A, has recently shown to reduce the cardiovascular risk. Iacobellis'group found that EAT thickness decreased by an unprecedented 36% after 12 weeks of treatment with liraglutide. Remarkably, Iacobellis'group found for the first time that human EAT express GLP-1 Receptor (GLP-1R). GLP-1A effects may be therefore visceral fat specific and target EAT. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that treatment with liraglutide will significantly and rapidly reduce EAT inflammation. Decreased EAT inflammation can reduce the burden of the coronary plaques. We will test our hypothesis in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, interventional study in 40 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and CAD, with an acceptable glycemic control on their current diabetes regimen who require elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) regardless of their participation in the study. A minimum time frame of 3-week treatment will be considered to detect significant changes in the study endpoints. Inclusion criteria for body fat markers will rule out the confounding effect of different body fast distribution at baseline. Study subjects will be randomized in two groups of 20 patients to receive additional liraglutide or to remain on current treatment/ placebo prior to cardiac surgery. CAD subjects not allocated to liraglutide will be started on a supervised low-calorie diet (LCD) to achieve approximately 5% of weight loss after from a minimum of 3 weeks up to 12 weeks to avoid the confounding effect of weight loss on the study outcomes. Fat samples will be collected during cardiac surgery after up to 12 weeks of treatment either with liraglutide or placebo and processed for analysis of mRNA and protein expression of EAT and SAT inflammatory genes such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and GLP-1R.", "phase": "PHASE4", "condition": "Type2 Diabetes", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

The clinical presentation is characterised by chronic swelling of limbs, accompanied by localised pain, skin changes and recurrent infections. It is caused by a disruption in lymphatic flow which prevents the normal circulation of interstitial fluid (situated in the spaces between the cells of the body), resulting in swelling of the affected limb. It can be primary (cause unknown) or secondary to a number of causes such as malignancy, trauma, surgery, radiotherapy, infection, or venous disease.\n\nIn breast cancer treatment, axillary surgery and radiotherapy significantly damage normal lymphatic drainage of the upper limb, causing lymphoedema in 1-in-5 patients.\n\nThere is a growing body of evidence that this chronic and debilitating condition can be better managed through early surgical intervention rather than the current conservative management, which rely on pressure garments and massage. This surgical intervention, lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA), joins up a number of the draining lymphatic vessels to correspondingly sized veins on the affected limb using microsurgical techniques. A special dye and camera system is used to facilitate identifying lymph vessels. This creates a new drainage pathway for the lymph fluid around the area of disruption, improving lymphatic flow. Volume reduction is expected and this would be expected to provide quality of life benefits for the patients.\n\nThis study seeks to compare the outcomes from both therapies and determine whether LVA surgery can help to improve the physical burden and quality of life for patients affected by lymphoedema. Furthermore, lymphoedema places a substantial burden on NHS services. If this trial is successful, LVA surgery could improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall cost of treatment.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Breast Cancer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

{"nct_id": "NCT04265339", "title": "The Interplay Between Addiction to Tobacco Smoking and Sleep Quality Among Healthy Adults", "brief_summary": "Tobacco smoking is a major health problem, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality due to cancer, impaired pulmonary function, and cardiovascular diseases. Chronic nicotine consumption related to smoking may affect pulmonary function and can cause neuronal alterations leading to increased emotional distress and decreased cognitive functioning, especially when the smoker attempts to quit. These may explain the huge difficulty in quitting and the dependence on cigarettes as a means of maintaining emotional balance. The possibility that reduced sleep quality is a major negative outcome that contributes to nicotine addiction has been largely overlooked. Several studies have shown that smoking and smoking cessation disrupt sleep quality; however, the vast majority of these studies were based on subjective reports. Moreover, it is not clear to what degree disrupted sleep quality among smokers may be related to reduced pulmonary function, and to what degree reduced sleep quality contributes to the emotional cognitive distress of active and abstinent smokers and to their urge to smoke. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that smoking and early phases of smoking cessation will be associated with reduced sleep quality. This poor sleep quality will be associated with emotional and cognitive symptoms and difficulty in abstaining from tobacco smoking. Successful abstinence from smoking over time will lead to normalization of the quality of sleep.\n\nExperiments to investigate this hypothesis will be conducted on healthy young adults addressing the following specific aims: 1) To examine physiological and psychological factors predicting reduced quality of sleep among smokers, including: poor pulmonary function, the degree of nicotine dependence, altered regulation of stress systems (HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system), and emotional distress (anxiety and depression); 2) To explore the impact of smoking cessation on sleep quality and related symptoms. Specifically, whether smoking cessation induces fragmented sleep and poor sleep quality, and whether the diminished sleep quality can predict the magnitude of emotional and cognitive symptoms; 3) To examine whether poor sleep (before and during abstinence) can predict the level of the urge to smoke and smoking relapse among abstinent smokers; 4) To explore whether sleep quality ultimately improves following prolonged abstinence from smoking. Addressing these aims, nonsmokers and smokers will be examined before and during smoking abstinence on the following measures: quality of sleep via actigraphy and polysomnography (PSG), pulmonary function test, biological markers of stress (cortisol and α-amylase) and smoking (i.e., cotinine, the main metabolite of nicotine), and emotional and cognitive functioning via psychometric tests.\n\nResults of this study will provide novel insight on the role of sleep in nicotine addiction. Experiments will show how reduced quality of sleep may result from chronic smoking and interfere with attempts to quit smoking. Also, the experiment will shed light on the interrelated physiological and psychological mechanisms that mediate the interplay between smoking addiction and sleep. The research will utilize a variety of powerful methods and an interdisciplinary collaboration of experts in the fields of sleep, addiction, and pulmonary medicine.

No standard second-line treatment has been defined for NECs. Despite a very negative prognosis, these NECs have a certain amount of chemosensitivity, close to that of bronchial NECs. Multiple-drug therapies such as Folfiri, or Folfox, or single drug treatments such as temozolomide are the proposed options but with a low level of proof Bevacizumab associated with a cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown promising results in well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), known for being hypervascular. The efficacy of bevacizumab has also been suggested in patients with NEC, but never in the context of a phase II study. Its combination with Folfiri is efficient and well tolerated in metastatic colorectal cancer. The combination Folfiri-bevacizumab potentially represents an optimized treatment compared to chemotherapy with only Folfiri. No phase II or III studies have reported results for these patients, and no on-going phase II or III trial have been identified to date.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to show that, after the failure of a first-line chemotherapy using platinum-etoposide, the combination Folfiri-bevacizumab allows significant prolongation of overall survival in adult patients with GEP-NEC.", "phase": "PHASE2", "condition": "Neuroendocrine Carcinomas", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["of this study is to show that, after the failure of a first-line chemotherapy using platinum-etoposide, the combination Folfiri-bevacizumab allows significant prolongation of overall survival in adult patients with GEP-NEC", "bevacizumab has also been suggested in patients with NEC, but never in the context of a phase II study"]}

The loss of weight and body tissues is a common condition in cancer patients with lesions of the airways and digestive tract and is related to anorexia and the presence and duration of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea. The latter directly interferes with the progression of enteral diets, which are administered in order to provide adequate nutritional support for the recovery of patients and nutritional status. In this sense, the importance of measures to help reduce diarrhea episodes is reinforced, aiming at the adequate infusion of enteral diets and, consequently, nutritional needs. It is known that the use of antimicrobials is closely related to the increased incidence of nasocomial diarrhea, as it facilitates colonization by pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium difficile. In addition, nosocomial diarrhea is a very relevant occurrence due to the financial burden it causes for the hospital institution, which can also worsen the patient's clinical condition, since he is weakened due to the underlying disease. Despite these important aspects, studies carried out with the aim of reducing diarrhea episodes in patients with airway and digestive lesions are still not described in the literature. In this context, the use of symbiotics presents itself as a possibly beneficial alternative, considering the role of probiotics and prebiotics in the modulation of intestinal function.

A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Lomustine is a chemotherapy drug and in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It damages the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid and may kill tumor cells.

Curative surgery offers the only chance of improving survival in this cancer. In patients whose cancer has not spread to other parts of the body (beyond the stomach and lymph nodes around it), removal of stomach (gastrectomy) with lymph nodes around the stomach and along the major vessels supplying blood to the stomach (D2 lymphadenectomy) is regarded as current standard of care at Tata Memorial Centre. However, the extent of lymphadenectomy is controversial. Some studies have suggested that removing more lymph nodes, even around the major vessels of the abdomen (aorta and inferior vena cava) may not only help to accurately determine the disease spread, but may also confer an additional survival benefit. Removing more lymph nodes around the major vessels may increase the risk of morbidity to the patient.\n\nIn the last 5-6 years, stomach cancer specialists around the world have resorted to giving half the cycles of chemotherapy to the patient before the surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy), and the other half after the surgery in what is called 'perioperative chemotherapy'. This has been shown to lead to more patients surviving to 5 years, than before.\n\nThe investigators feel that perioperative chemotherapy with D2 lymphadenectomy may constitute the best care for our patients with stomach cancer such that no further removal of lymph nodes beyond is required. However, the investigators have no evidence in literature to support this hypothesis. The investigators have thus designed this trial based on which we propose that there exists no difference between a D2 lymphadenectomy and a D3 lymphadenectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for non-metastatic, locally advanced but resectable gastric cancer. The data will enable the development of clear management guidelines for lymph node dissection in stomach cancer.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Gastric Cancer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

Improving the quality of life and better pain relief is therefore an essential goal of the treatment of metastatic disease.

It consists in a filling of the bone cavity created by metastasis using an acrylic resin. However, these approaches do not completely prevent the risk of upper femoral epiphyseal fracture due to the low mechanical resistance of the resin to shear movements.\n\nThe Y-STRUT® implantable medical device was developed to overcome this risk of superior femoral epiphyseal fracture by the biomechanical strengthening of the proximal femur in addition to cementoplasty.

Unfortunately, both the chemotherapy drugs used in this setting (anthracyclines) and trastuzumab are known to cause cardiac dysfunction in a proportion of patients. Patients who develop heart problems when taking trastuzumab might have to stop this treatment, which could jeopardise their chances of cure. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) is a cardiac biomarker that is measured in the blood, the levels of which have been shown to indicate the presence of heart failure. Some early research has suggested that there may be a correlation between elevated NT pro-BNP and heart damage due to cancer chemotherapy and also trastuzumab. Troponin is another substance measured in the blood that can indicate heart damage. Finally, certain variations in an individual's genetic makeup (called polymorphisms) could put them at increased risk of heart damage from trastuzumab. Here we are studying whether any of these factors (NT pro-BNP levels, troponin levels, or certain genetic polymorphisms) can accurately predict who is at highest risk of trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity.\n\nThe principal aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of NT pro-BNP as a predictive biomarker for the development of trastuzumab related cardiotoxicity (TRC).

Its incidence is increasing. As epidermoid ACC (95% of ACC) are particularly sensitive to radio and chemotherapy, concomitant radio-chemotherapy is the standard treatment of locally advanced ACC, with proven efficacy on locoregional control, anal sphincter preservation, progression-free survival and complete response rate higher than 80%.\n\nNevertheless, conventional radiotherapy frequently induces significant non-haematological toxicities requiring treatment interruptions. Thus, treatment usually includes a chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil and Mitomycine-C) and 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy followed by a planned 1-week (or more) interruption and a boost, for a total 54-60 Gy radiation dose over 9 weeks.\n\nConsidering the numerous anatomic pelvic structures, ACC has become a localisation of interest for Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) associated with less toxicity.\n\nHowever, IMRT induces grade≥3 cutaneous toxicities requiring irradiation breaks. Dose escalade did not show its interest: 60 Grays remains the standard.\n\nAssuming the deleterious effect of increased overall treatment time on local control and survival in head-and-neck and cervical cancers and the epidermoid histology of ACC, the benefit of no irradiation break on ACC tumour control is of interest.\n\nIMRT offers the possibility to deliver different doses to different target volumes simultaneously by altered fractionation schedule like SIB-IMRT (simultaneously integrated boost-IMRT). Several SIB-IMRT schedules have been retrospectively evaluated. Similar results were observed with moderate doses and schedules delivering higher doses with short interruptions. Nevertheless, standard SIB-IMRT schedule in ACC still not exist.", "phase": "PHASE2", "condition": "Locally Advanced Anal Canal Cancer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

This subgroup of cancers, accounting for about 20 to 30% of gastric adenocarcinomas, is associated with particularly poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. A proteomic landscape of diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinomas was recently reported.\n\nPembrolizumab, an anti-PDL1 drug granted with an accelerated approval by FDA in September 2017, exhibited promising activity in gastric adenocarcinoma patients previously treated with 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy (ORR=11.6%, median PFS = 2.0 months, median OS= 5.6 months), especially in those with PDL1 positive tumors (ORR=22.7%). The tumor response was particularly high in patients with MSI-high tumor (ORR=57.1%). However the preliminary outcomes of the phase III KEYNOTE-061 trial (NCT02370498) recently released in the press suggest that pembrolizumab was not superior to paclitaxel in 592 patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma whose disease progressed after first-line treatment with platinum and fluoropyrimidine doublet therapy (the hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.82 (95% confidence interval = 0.66-1.03; one sided P = .042) (http://www.ascopost.com/News/58377).\n\nThese outcomes suggest that, although being very promising, immunotherapy should be combined to other agents for being fully effective in gastric adenocarcinomas patients.\n\nWe propose a strategy based on molecular features to select the drugs that will be associated with atezolizumab, an anti-PDL1 drug, in patients with pre-treated advanced gastric adenocarcinomas:\n\n* Patients with tumors positive for EBV or microsatellite instable tumors (30%) will be treated with atezolizumab and ipatasertib.\n* Patients with genomically stable tumors (20%) will be treated with atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab.\n* Patients with tumors with chromosomal instability (50%) will be treated with atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab.\n\nExpected outcomes:\n\nIMMUNOGAST trial will provide data about the clinical feasibility of biomolecular characterization of gastric adenocarcinomas for routine treatment adjustment. Moreover it should generate information about the relevance of adjusting combined immunotherapies based on molecular subtypes, in terms of clinical efficacy. Finally, translational research project outcomes should provide important data about relationships between efficacy and tumor immune gene spatial expression, along with tumor and circulating mutational burden.

Obesity and related dysmetabolic states including metabolic syndrome (MetS) are highly prevalent causes of subclinical inflammation. Obesity and MetS are both diet and lifestyle-related and there is a growing body of literature suggesting that specific nutrients, such as long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA), may attenuate the pro-inflammatory state associated with these conditions. However, careful review of existing literature on this topic reveals important gaps in knowledge, the purported anti-inflammatory effects of LCn-3PUFA even being questioned by many. Significant confounding attributable to study design, sample size and biomarker selection may be responsible in part for inconsistencies in the literature on LCn-3PUFA and inflammation. We also found that evidence available to date (for and against) is based primarily on secondary analyses, as most of the studies published were not primarily designed to investigate inflammation as a primary outcome. It remains unclear whether the different LCn-3PUFA, primarily docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), have similar effects on pro-inflammatory processes as almost all studies were undertaken using a mix of LCn-3PUFA. Whether efficacy of EPA and DHA is influenced by sex/gender is also unknown. Finally, a better understanding of the systemic and tissue-specific mechanisms underlying the anticipated anti-inflammatory effects of different LCn-3PUFA in MetS would also be of great value.

While colorectal cancer is surgically curable if diagnosed in the early stages, with five year survival rates of 90% versus 10% if detected at more advanced stages, less than 20 % of all individuals in this age bracket traditionally have undergone colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer often presents with non-specific symptoms where non-cancerous polyps are commonly found.

However, up to a quarter of clinically significant tumors, which may pose a risk to patient's well-being, may be missed on random biopsies. MRI enables detection of further tumors in this patient population, but also has limited accuracy.\n\nStudy hypothesis:\n\nWe hypothesize that hybrid PET-MRI, a novel scanner which incorporates MRI with molecular imaging will improve the detection rate of clinically significant tumors.\n\nStudy design:\n\nIn this prospective trial, we will recruit 57 men who are suspected of having prostate cancer but have had negative systematic biopsies, who have been diagnosed with low-risk disease but have clinically signs of more aggressive tumor or who have a focal tumor detected and are candidates for minimally-invasive tumor ablation (=tumor destruction with laser or ultrasound waves), in whom it is crucial to exclude other tumor sites.\n\nAll patients will undergo PET/MRI after injection of a radiopharmaceutical called \"18F-DCFPyL\". This is a radioactive probe which has been shown in preliminary studies to be sensitive and specific for detection of prostate cancer.\n\nAll lesions detected on PET/MRI will undergo biopsy under ultrasound using fused PET/MRI and ultrasound images for guidance, and compared to histopathology. The primary outcome measure in this study is the proportion of clinically significant prostate cancers that are detected with PET/MRI compared to MRI alone.

Sixty-five percent of the patients receive opioids at the PACU. Their maximum pain score at the PACU is registered, using a numerical rating scale of 0-10, as 3.28 ± 2.65 (Mean ± SD).

Obesity in CLD augments decompensation, plausibly through increase in portal pressure. Moreover, the cardiometabolic risk factors are increased with increase in body weight, obesity also has an impact on the already compromised health-related quality of life of patients with CLD. Most feasible, safe, and widely used method of management of obesity is life-style modifications. Hypocaloric with normal to high protein diet along with moderate-intensity exercises have been practiced for weight reduction.\n\nThese kinds of dietary changes reduce body weight and may bring about favourable changes in the body composition (reduce the body fat percentage but at the same time preserving the lean body mass). Weight loss in obese patients with CLD would in turn improve the clinical outcome, reduce the hepatic complications, moreover weight loss may also improve health related quality of life, and other prognostic markers of the disease like fibroscan along with improvement in the associated metabolic derangements in patients with CLD. There is no Indian data in this context. Thus, through this trial, investigator would be able to ascertain an appropriate lifestyle-related non- intervention regimen that helps in the management of obesity in patients with cirrhosis.

We aim to recruit thirty patients with early rectal cancer who are due to undergo an operation to remove their cancer. After recruiting and consenting them for the trial, we will treat their rectal cancer with HIFU. Approximately one week after treatment they will undergo their normal cancer operation. This will allow us to demonstrate the safety of HIFU as a treatment for rectal cancer and evaluate the changes in rectal and surrounding tissue under the microscope after the cancer is treated with HIFU. In addition, we will monitor patients for any complications and the impact this treatment has on their quality of life.

{"nct_id": "NCT03909802", "title": "Effect of Self- and Family Management of Diabetic Foot Ulcers Programs on Health Outcomes", "brief_summary": "Brief description:\n\nDiabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is described as a full-thickness lesion appearing at the skin of the foot along with infection, destruction of tissues due to neuropathy and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD) in people with diabetes (International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot, 2015). DFU commonly develops in middle-aged diabetic patients due to a long period of type 2 diabetes and poor adherence to control blood glucose level (Madanchi et al., 2013). Prevalence of DFU was four times higher than all combined cases of cancers in the world (Boulton, 2013; McInnes, 2012; Shaw, Sicree, \\& Zimmet, 2010). Numerous published studies have documented the rate of DFU at around 25% in Western Population (Boulton, 2013). Prevalence of DFU was stated between 7.3 % - 24 % at Indonesia hospitals (Soewondo, Ferrario, \\& Tahapary, 2013). An Indonesia nursing study recorded 12 % of diabetic foot ulcer cases from 249 individuals with type 2 diabetes in a regional hospital of Eastern Indonesia (Yusuf et al., 2015). Cases of infected DFU occurred in 98 patients in Sardjito Hospital Yogyakarta Indonesia in 2016 (Longdong, 2016).\n\nIn order to diminish the wide-reaching impact of DFU, a number of efforts have been performed in Indonesia. A study documented that sufficient diabetic patients' knowledge in performing foot care is able to decrease the incidence of DFU as well as LEA (Wulandini, Saputra, \\& Basri, 2013). Foot ulcers health education program was interrelated with patients' knowledge as well as attitudes concerning responsibility and involvement in DFU care (Arianti, Yetti, \\& Nasution, 2012; Mahfud, 2012; Sa'adah, Primanda, \\& Wardaningsih, 2016; Yoyoh, Mutaqqin, \\& Nurjanah, 2016). In line with their findings, another study confirmed that intensive health promotion increased patients' knowledge and practice in regard to perform routine foot care (Abbas, 2013). Also, health promotion intervention improves Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in type 2 Diabetes (Brown, 1990; Norris, Lau, Smith, Schmid, \\& Engelgau, 2002; Florkowski, 2013). However, a number of these studies merely focused on the patient, not engaged family members as it may potentially reduce the effectiveness of therapy.\n\nAccordingly, DFU is currently being a critical problems needs to be solved in Indonesia. Ensuring the engagement of both the patients and their families in treatment is an important strategy to deal with the chronic conditions (Baig, Benitez, Quinn, \\& Burnet, 2015; Miller \\& DiMatteo, 2013; Pamungkas, Chamroonsawasdi, \\& Vatanasomboon, 2017). Therefore, conducting a comprehensive intervention of DFU partnering individuals and their families in association with self-and family management is a groundbreaking and challenging strategy to overcome problems on DFU. We believe the findings of our study will render significant contributions to the national guideline of diabetes in Indonesia and prevention of LEA in nursing practice. Furthermore, it will be able to give promising results for accelerating DFU healing.\n\nPurposes of the study:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a self- and family management of DFU programs on health outcomes as follows: behaviors (adherence to physical activities, medications, diet, foot care, and blood glucose control), family supports, biomarkers (HbA1c, wound size) in patients suffering DFU in Indonesia.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe study participants who joined completely the self- and family management of diabetic foot ulcer programs during three months would have a better behavior, biomarkers, and family supports than those who received the usual care.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Diabete Mellitus", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

HNC survivors have a 20-24 percent lifetime risk of pneumonia after RT, which is associated with a 42 percent excess risk of death in survivorship. Moreover, dysphagia predisposes individuals to malnutrition, and at least half of HNC patients require feeding tubes during RT.\n\nPatients are commonly referred for swallowing therapy with a speech pathologist. Some patients receive early intervention, before a swallowing problem begins-PRO-ACTIVE therapy. Other patients are monitored and prescribed dysphagia interventions only if and when a swallowing problem occurs-RE-ACTIVE therapy. Thus, REACTIVE therapy aims to reverse an already impaired swallowing ability, whereas PRO-ACTIVE therapy aims to prevent or reduce severity of dysphagia. These two broad categories of therapy represent the most common types of intervention offered to HNC patients across North America. Although there is single-institution evidence to support each practice, it is yet unknown which is most effective.\n\nTo address this gap, the primary aim of this international, multi-site 3-arm pragmatic randomized clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of PRO-ACTIVE (high and low intensity) versus RE-ACTIVE swallowing therapy among 952 patients with HNC planning to undergo RT, using duration of feeding tube dependence after RT as the primary outcome.

Nuclear medicine provides potentially life-saving information regarding physiological processes, and is of particular value in children where the rapid and unequivocal diagnosis of pathological concerns is essential for the health of these patients. The overall objective of this investigation is to optimize pediatric patient absorbed dose by keeping it as low as possible while maintaining excellent diagnostic quality of nuclear medicine images. This is particularly important since children are at increased risk due to the enhanced radiosensitivity of their tissues and the longer time-period over which radiation effects may manifest. Current dosimetric estimations in children are based on either animal biokinetic or pharmacokinetic data from adults due to paucity of data that exists for children. This situation will be improved through the following specific aims:\n\n* Collect image-based pharmacokinetic (PK) data from patient volunteers in different age groups scheduled for routine nuclear medicine studies for F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radiopharmaceutical commonly used in pediatric nuclear medicine\n* Pool and analyze the data for different age groups for each radiopharmaceuticals and\n* Generate biokinetic models to be used in subsequent dosimetric models for the optimization of pediatric nuclear medicine procedures.\n\nSince inadequate pharmacokinetic data currently exist in these patients, the investigators will use the data acquired in this study to establish PK models applicable to different age categories. Data on the pharmacokinetics of agents used in pediatric nuclear medicine are almost completely lacking. Internationally adopted dose coefficients (mSv/MBq) for pediatric nuclear medicine make age-dependent adjustments only for patient size and anatomical differences, while time-dependent kinetics from adult PK models are assumed due to the lack of kinetic data for children. The data obtained from this study will make it possible for the first time to determine how the PK in pediatric patients differs from adults. This will be done for F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radiopharmaceutical commonly used for pediatric nuclear medicine imaging. The overall hope is that results will allow the molecular imaging community to implement pediatric dose-reduction approaches that substantially improve upon current guidelines pointing to future technological advances that could yield even greater dose-reduction while simultaneously improving diagnostic image quality.", "phase": "PHASE4", "condition": "Childhood Neoplasm", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["of this investigation is to optimize pediatric patient absorbed dose by keeping it as low as possible while maintaining excellent diagnostic quality of nuclear medicine images", "how the PK in pediatric patients differs from adults"]}

Blockade of the EGFR results in inhibition of multiple downstream pathways, leading to slowed tumor growth. In addition, these inhibitors may enhance anti-tumor immune responses through uncharacterized mechanisms. While producing significant responses in many settings, EGFR inhibitors also result in significant skin toxicity (rash) in a high percentage of patients. Multiple studies have correlated the presence and severity of rash with clinical response. Unfortunately, severe rash can often lead to dose delays, reductions, or even discontinuation of EGFR inhibitors, thus limiting their efficacy. The mechanism of both the rash and its correlation with tumor response is poorly understood. Skin biopsies display a robust leukocyte infiltrate, but a systematic analysis of the type of infiltrating leukocytes, activation state, or homing receptor expression has not been performed. Chemokines and chemokine receptors control leukocyte trafficking to the skin and other tissue sites, and defined receptor profiles for skin-, gut-, and lung-homing leukocytes are well established. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the homing phenotype of leukocytes from peripheral blood and skin biopsies of patients receiving EGFR inhibitors.

IL-17A is part of the immune system and helps the body fight infections, but too much of it can lead to inflammation, which can be harmful.\n\nThe researchers want to find out if the levels of IL-17A in the blood are connected to important health outcomes for patients, such as whether they survive in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), after 30 days, and after 60 days. They will also check how long patients can stay off a ventilator and how many days they need to use a mechanical ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe when their lungs are not working well.\n\nIn addition to the main goal, the researchers will study how IL-17A relates to a severe form of ARDS called the hyperinflammatory sub-phenotype. They will also look at how IL-17A connects with other health markers, including IL-6, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR), IL8, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)a, IL1beta, and IL23. These markers can give information about inflammation and how the body is responding to illness.\n\nTo compare results, the researchers will include a control group of patients who had Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) but did not have ARDS. This control group will help them understand the differences between the two conditions.\n\nThis research will use data from the FROG-ICU Registry, which gathers information on patients in intensive care units across Europe. The registry tracks patients' health after they leave the ICU, focusing on the risk factors for death in the year following their discharge. The data comes from 28 different ICUs in 19 hospitals.\n\nThe researchers will create two groups of patients based on their diagnoses: one group with ARDS and another with ARF.

{"nct_id": "NCT06266325", "title": "Development and Validation of a Dementia Life Expectancy Tool", "brief_summary": "Individuals with dementia and their caregivers are faced with challenging decisions throughout the course of the disease. These decisions may be about medical care (e.g., continuation of routine cancer screening, pursuit of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, initiation of palliative care services), institutionalization (i.e., transition to a long-term care facility), or financial planning. These inherently difficult decisions are made more difficult by prognostic uncertainty. Indeed, life expectancy is challenging to predict in dementia. Consequently, prognosis is infrequently discussed by healthcare providers with individuals with dementia and their families, which compromises their ability to plan for the future. A lack of prognostic awareness makes it difficult for patients, their caregivers, and their healthcare providers to make medical decisions that strike the appropriate balance between prolonging life and promoting the quality of it. A clinical prediction tool has the promise to provide personalized and accurate estimations of life expectancy in individuals with dementia. Therefore, similar to the existing clinical prediction tools on our Project Big Life platform (www.projectbiglife.ca), we seek to create and to test a statistical model to predict survival, and to implement the model as a user-friendly, web-based calculator. The calculator will use self-reported sociodemographic, clinical, cognitive, functional, and nutritional information that is entered by patients, their caregivers, and/or their healthcare providers to output an estimated life expectancy.

The 1-year and 5-year survival rate is approximately 20% and \\<5% respectively. The treatment options available are limited. Only around 10-20% of patients present early enough to undergo surgical resection. Furthermore, chemotherapy for more advanced pancreatic cancer leads to limited survival benefit and can cause significant side effects. One of the main obstacles to developing new treatments for pancreatic cancer is the limited understanding of how pancreatic cancer cells change/evolve/adapt following treatment.\n\nThis study is a pilot study to assess whether the investigators can track gene expression (using a technique called RNA sequencing) in pancreatic cancer cells between two separate time points. Investigators intend to take a tissue sample (biopsy) of the cancer using endoscopy ultrasound (EUS) and compare it with samples taken either at the time of surgery in those patients with resectable disease or follow-up EUS derived biopsies in irresectable cancers.\n\nThe interval between endoscopy and follow-up EUS or surgery will be approximately 2 to 3 weeks and reflects the standard period of time that patients wait from the time point at which the cancer is deemed to be operable (in the multi-disciplinary team meeting) to the actual operation.\n\nIf the investigators find that the samples (biopsies) taken at EUS and at surgery or follow-up EUS are comparable they plan to develop future clinical trials of similar design but with the addition of drug therapy. The investigators will use RNA sequencing to interrogate the effects of novel cancer drugs on gene expression within the tumour. This will give them information on how to select patients for therapy, how resistance develops to these treatments, and allow the investigators to better understand what treatments can be combined on a rational basis.

Research indicates that individuals engaging in sexual activity have a lifetime probability of HPV infection as high as 85% to 90%. While extensive and in-depth investigations have been conducted on HPV infection in women, epidemiological studies focusing on male HPV infection remain relatively scarce. Many men with HPV are asymptomatic; reports suggest that approximately 10.5% of men in China are infected with HPV, yet only about 1% exhibit related symptoms. This substantial population of asymptomatic and unaware patients poses significant challenges for the prevention and control efforts regarding HPV in China. Furthermore, evidence suggests an association between HPV infection and conditions such as condyloma acuminatum, penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN), penile cancer (PA), and even infertility among male patients. In current clinical practice, detection of HPV typically involves collecting exfoliated cells from the external genitalia via swabs. The discomfort associated with this sampling method and its procedural complexity often deter many asymptomatic men from undergoing penile swab testing for HPV, resulting in low compliance rates. Self-sampling urine tests offer advantages including convenience, ease of use, painlessness, and non-invasiveness; thus they may serve as a viable alternative approach. In prior research endeavors, we successfully established a detection system utilizing female urine samples for identifying HPV presence. Consequently, this study aims to further refine this detection system to develop a stable and reliable methodology for detecting HPV using self-collected urine samples from males. Through this investigation not only do we seek to validate the feasibility of employing self-collected urine samples for detecting male HPV infections but also assess the accuracy and practicality of home-based self-testing methods among subjects-ultimately providing novel strategies for male-specific HPV detection", "phase": null, "condition": "HPV", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["to further refine this detection system to develop a stable and reliable methodology for detecting HPV using self-collected urine samples from males"]}

Children may develop severe, debilitating clinical states, with stroke or abnormal blood flow to the brain. Treatment generally includes chronic blood transfusions which may cause iron overload, potentially leading to severe and sometimes fatal complications.\n\nHematopoietic stem cell transplant using cells obtained from a sibling or an unrelated volunteer donor who is a perfect HLA \"match\" (same tissue type) for the recipient has shown to help, and possibly cure, sickle cell disease. Unfortunately, only about 10-20% of sickle cell patients have a HLA matched sibling donor, and the likelihood of locating an appropriate HLA matched unrelated donor through the various donor registries is limited.\n\nStem cells from partially HLA matched family members (also called haploidentical transplant) is an option currently being explored for this patient population. This type of transplant has been used and found to be successful in some patients, mostly those with cancers of the blood. However, there can be significant complications with haploidentical transplant, primarily infection, failure of the graft to grow (graft failure), and a disorder called graft-versus-host disease. In addition, few patients with sickle cell disease have undergone this procedure. Therefore, the risks and benefits of haploidentical transplants for patients with sickle cell disorder are not as well established as those using an HLA identical sibling or unrelated donor.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of haploidentical stem cell transplantation for children and adolescents with severe sickle cell disease and stroke or abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound requiring chronic transfusion therapy. The treatment plan will be considered safe if there is not excessive toxicity. Toxicity for this protocol is defined as graft failure/graft rejection, severe acute GVHD, or regimen related death within 100 days after the last cellular product administered.\n\nOf note, the protocol was closed to accrual in September 2007 as we had met the stopping rules related to graft integrity (graft failure and graft rejection).

The surgical procedure involves resection of the tumor and reconstruction with a so called microvascular free flap, i.e. tissue transferred from for instance the arm or leg to the resection site. Complications of this complex procedure include, but are not limited to, bleeding and blood cloths (thrombosis) in the transferred tissue (free flap), which can cause very serious complications including need for further surgery and loss of the flap.\n\nRoutine blood tests can measure parts of the system that regulates bleeding and the forming of blood clots, the so called coagulation system, but these tests don't cover the whole system. There are however more advanced instruments, such as ROTEM, rotational thromboelastometry, which provide a more global view of the hemostatic potential of whole blood. ROTEM is one of few more advanced assays that can be analyzed in emergency situations in major hospitals. Other more advanced coagulation assays are thrombin generation and measurements of specific coagulation factors, several of which are vitamin K dependent. Vitamin K is essential in the coagulation system and also involved in many other physiological processes. Deficiency of this vitamin is common, but not well studied in patients undergoing head an neck free flap surgery.\n\nThe investigators plan to study ROTEM and other above mentioned coagulation parameters in patients undergoing major head and neck surgery including microvascular free flap reconstruction to assess if these parameters can help predict patients at risk for bleeding or flap thrombosis. Further on this could hopefully enable prevention of complications and improve treatment of coagulation complications that still occur.", "phase": null, "condition": "Head and Neck Cancer", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["if these parameters can help predict patients at risk for bleeding or flap thrombosis"]}

In Laos, 61-80% of male PWH and 3-10% of female PWH smoke cigarettes. PWH who smoke in Laos have no reliable smoking cessation support. Thus, implementing sustainable and evidence-based smoking cessation interventions for PWH in Laos is needed. The investigators developed a scalable and affordable mHealth-based automated treatment program (MAP) to support Lao and Cambodian smokers to quit smoking. MAP involves interactive, tailored, personalized content (text messages, photos, and videos) delivered via a smartphone app. Along with effective cessation treatments, it is imperative to implement procedures to identify patients who smoke and to connect them to treatment. Our team pioneered the Ask-Advise-Connect (AAC, asking patients about smoking at every visit, briefly advising those who smoke to quit, and connecting them to treatment) approach, which showed great impact in our previous US studies. The purpose of this study is to compare 2 smoking cessation implementation strategies in 8 antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the 6 most populous regions in Laos, using a hybrid type-2 pragmatic effectiveness-implementation study and a parallel cluster randomized trial design. Specifically, the investigators will compare an AAC approach paired with our previously developed MAP (AA-MAP) to an AAC approach paired with less resource-intensive printed self-help material (AA-SH).

Various studies evaluated the application of DW-MRI to diffuse liver disease and focal liver lesions providing controversial results, probably due to the difficult reproducibility of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements. It is conceivable that a wide inter/intra-individual variability actually exists in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-values, and that each apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-value presents an higher reliability in measuring the temporal changes of water diffusion within the same individual (longitudinal-evaluation), than in characterizing tissues between different patients (transverse-evaluation). For these reasons, some previous studies assessed the application of DW-MRI in predicting the chemotherapy (CHT) outcome in liver metastases. The rationale of these studies was the overt biochemical changes shown by the neoplastic cells after CHT and the sensitivity of DW-MRI in the identification of such changes. The same authors noticed that the metastatic lesions with the lowest ADC-values present also the best outcome after CHT. Moreover, these studies suggest that it could be possible to assess if each single patient will respond (R) or not (NR) to the CHT through liver DW-MRI performed from 3 days to 3 weeks after the beginning of CHT.", "phase": null, "condition": "Liver Metastases", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["if each single patient will respond (R) or not (NR) to the CHT through liver DW-MRI performed from 3 days to 3 weeks after the beginning of CHT"]}

If the levels of integrin αvβ6 in cancer cells can be measured by carrying out PET scans, we might be able to identify and potentially treat tumours.\n\nFBA-A20FMDV2 is a substance that binds or sticks to integrin αvβ6. It may therefore be possible to find and measure the amount of integrin αvβ6 in tumours. To do this a small amount of radioactivity will be attached to FBA-A20FMDV2 and carry out a scan called a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. FBA-A20FMDV2 attached to radioactivity is known as \\[18F\\]FBA-A20FMDV2 or a radiotracer, as a very small amount of tracer dose is given to humans.\n\nSo far such scans have been carried out in healthy volunteers and in patients with a lung condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This was to assess the safety of the radiotracer and how it is taken up in the body. However, such scans have not been performed in cancer patients.

The majority of newly diagnosed patients have higher stage, often disseminated, non-resectable disease. A better understanding of the natural biology and molecular abnormalities in early lung lesions may aid in the development of more effective screening tools. This study will investigate the effectiveness of bronchoscopy by white light (WL) alone and in combination with Lung Imaging Fluorescence Endoscopy (LIFE) for the detection of early lung lesions in patients with a high risk for developing lung cancer. LIFE is a FDA approved adjunct to WL bronchoscopy for the screening of lung cancer and this study will provide a standardized setting in which a direct comparison between a combination of WL and LIFE versus traditional WL bronchoscopy can be made.\n\nIn addition, the study will set the stage for the collection of a unique set of biopsy specimens that will be used to learn more about the natural biology and the molecular changes in early lung lesions. We will study abnormalities in p53 by immunohistochemistry and by molecular analyses. The p53 results will be compared with histological grade and with genomic instability. Measures for genomic instability will be the loss of chromosomal information and cellular aneuploidy. Recent advances in molecular pathology, such as the development of Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), have made the molecular profiling of these extremely small lesions feasible. The information obtained by these techniques will be used for comparison with clinical and exposure information. Future plans include the culturing of bronchial epithelial cells to study genomic instability in the multistep process of cancer progression.

TAK-228 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (IC50 = 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents cellular proliferation.\n\nThe mTOR complex (mTORC) is an important therapeutic target that is generally stable (i.e., low tendency to mutate) and is a key intracellular point of convergence for a number of cellular signaling pathways. Inhibiting mTOR may inhibit abnormal cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, and abnormal cellular metabolism, thus providing the rationale for mTOR inhibitors as potential agents in the treatment of a number of indications including solid tumor and hematological malignancies, as either monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Like rapamycin, several newly approved rapalogs (temsirolimus and everolimus) are specific and allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, and only partially inhibit mTORC1 signaling pathways.

NEXI-001 is a type of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents. It works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy, with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps prepare the body for the new CAR-T cells.

{"nct_id": "NCT04659837", "title": "Training Response Inhibition to Obesogenic Foods", "brief_summary": "Dietary choices, and in particular, excess calorie intake leading to obesity, are strong, but reversible risk factors for cancer. For example, foods high in added sugars are low-nutrient, high calorie foods that increase the risk of cancer by promoting weight gain. As such, the reduction of sweets is consistent with American Institute for Cancer Research and the American Cancer Society dietary recommendations. Behavioral interventions to alter diet have limited long-term efficacy, most likely because eating decisions are governed by automatic neurocognitive processes that are not addressed in conventional interventions. In particular, the ability to refrain from consuming unhealthy, but widely available, palatable foods, is increasingly understood to depend on inhibitory control, i.e., the ability to cut off action tendencies that are put in motion by innate drives towards rewarding behaviors. Recent work by our team and others have demonstrated that computer-based inhibitory control trainings result in short-term, specific changes in behavior, such as reducing intake of salty snack food, chocolate, and alcoholic beverages. An automatized, home computer-based inhibitory control training offers the potential of an inexpensive and highly disseminable method of lowering cancer risk across wide swaths of the population. As such, we aim to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, mechanism of action, effectiveness and persistence of a home computer-based inhibitory control training. In particular, we hypothesize that a high-repetition training in inhibitory control will result in increased adherence to a low-sugar diet, and that effects will be mediated through improved inhibitory control. We further hypothesize that gamefying the training will improve efficacy because it will boost compliance with the daily trainings. We also hypothesize that the training will be most effective for those starting of with impaired inhibitory control, as well as those with strongest desire for palatable foods and those with strongest explicit health goals. Lastly, we aim to examine the impact of inhibitory control training on secondary outcomes, including on overall caloric intake, and on short-term weight loss. To achieve these aims, the proposed study will recruit 100 overweight and obese individuals who currently eat high-sugar diets, and who wish to improve their diets. Participants will be assigned a reduced-sugar diet for 8 weeks. After a baseline period, participants will be randomized, via a 2 x 2 factorial design, to receive 6 weeks of either inhibitory control training or a sham training, and either a gamified or non-gameified training. The 6-week intervention will consist of 15 minutes per day of home computer- based inhibitory control training, and will be followed by a 1-week booster and then 1-week follow-up period. Dietary adherence will be measured via a food frequency questionnaire and via automated 24-hour food recall. Neurocognitive variables will be assessed pre and post-training in order to test trainings' mechanism of action, and moderation will be assessed through baseline trait measures of explicit health goals, implicit attitudes towards appetitive stimuli, body mass index, and responsivity to food cues.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Inhibitory Control Training", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, mechanism of action, effectiveness and persistence of a home computer-based inhibitory control training", "the feasibility, acceptability, mechanism of action, effectiveness and persistence of a home computer-based inhibitory control training"]}

There are number of studies indicating that brain tumors and their treatment modalities are often related to cognitive dysfunction. Apart from primary brain lesions, deficit can also occur because of Surgery, Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, Antiepileptic and Corticosteroid treatment.Anaesthesia can also add to cognitive deficit in these patients. According to Ali et al. propofol provides better cognition scores compared to sevoflurane than isoflurane. The primary aim of their study was to compare the effects of 3 anesthetic regimens on hemodynamics and recovery characteristics of the patients. However in another study by Magni et al., the authors found that there is no difference in early cognitive function between sevoflurane and propofol. The aim of this prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial was to compare clinical properties of sevoflurane-fentanyl with propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in patients undergoing supratentorial intracranial surgery. However both these studies evaluated the early cognitive function. The primary endpoint was to compare early postoperative recovery and cognitive functions within the two groups. They also evaluated hemodynamic events, vomiting, shivering, and pain. The literature is scarce on the severity, incidence and effect of anaesthetics on cognition and quality of life of these patients. Since most of the patients of brain tumor cannot be cured with surgery alone, improvement of quality of life and palliative care of the symptoms and cognitive function are important part of the treatment. Now the cognitive function has also been considered as an independent prognostic factor in the survival of patients of brain tumor. Cognitive function can also be related to tumor laterality. Patients with tumors in left hemisphere will have lower scores on verbal tests, whereas tumor in right hemisphere will have lower scores on facial recognition tests. Patients with tumors in the left hemisphere report more difficulty concentrating and those with right-hemisphere lesions,report more tension.

After LT, integrating an addiction team into the LT program has been advocated by the latest guidelines in Europe and the United States, in order to bring the management of alcohol-use disorder (AUD) in transplantation units, through the association of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions previously reported in AALD. However, those guidelines were based on descriptive studies, and the effect of this management needs to be confirmed through a randomized, controlled, multicenter study, involving centers that still do not include an addiction team in their LT programs.\n\nThis study will therefore assess prospectively and comparatively the impact of an addiction intervention after LT on return to alcohol use rates.

Primarily, investigators want to study a risk assessment called the Anal Cancer Risk Index; it gives women an overall number score based on risk factors that they may have for anal cancer, such as age, number of sexual partners, or smoking. Investigators seek to understand whether women with higher Anal Cancer Risk Index scores are more likely to have abnormal results on anal pap smears, HPV tests, or anal biopsies. The study team will collect swabs of the cervix and the anus to study different laboratory tests that could identify women at highest risk of cervical and anal cancer. These laboratory tests include an anal pap smear, tests for markers of disease and tests that detect the HPV types most likely to cause cancer. The study team would like to see which of these laboratory tests do the best job at predicting precancerous lesions in the anus and are better indicators of risk for cancer. After collecting these swabs, women will have a procedure called high resolution anoscopy where investigators look closely at the anus and biopsy any suspicious areas.

Few antibiotics have shown any efficacy in their combat, but have not yet proven adequate to stop the spread of the disease, nor are there any approved vaccines at the moment. From experiments in plants ongoing infections by RNA viruses, using thermotherapy, which is the application of heat at a temperature between 35-43 °C, the investigators know that raising the temperature affects the transcription of viral proteins due to the formation of small RNA molecules that interrupt the replication process by grouping in specific regions of the RNA molecule, preventing and inhibiting transcription. These small molecules are called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). This feature has been used through thermotherapy in humans to combat the rapid replication of cells (i.e. cancer cells), attack cells infected by RNA viruses, and in the treatment of some parasitic infections.There are various commercially available devices for thermotherapy use in humans; they are mainly being used to ease muscle pain. They work by increasing the temperature in the range recommended for thermotherapy in humans 39-43 ° C.

Early functional limitations affect short- and long-term quality of life, and may lead to long-term complications. Patients living in rural areas are at particular risk because they do not have easy access to services. Therefore, early intervention is indicated to have an impact on the overall public health. Problem solving training (PST) is a standardized manual driven intervention that may be ideally suited to assist breast cancer patients to preserve their valued activities and to comply with recommended symptom management regimens (e.g., physical therapy, aerobic exercise and relaxation/guided imagery) that improve function. Telephone-based PST provided from a centralized location (such as the comprehensive cancer center) may improve access and outcomes in a cost-effective manner. We propose to conduct a feasibility study of a PST intervention with 30 rural breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant treatment randomly assigned to PST or to usual care. The intervention group will receive weekly phone-based PST sessions for six consecutive weeks. The specific aims of this R03 small grant application are to:1) Test the feasibility of enrolling and retaining newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in a clinical trial to assess telephone-based PST. 2) Collect preliminary data on outcome measures of function to determine effect size estimates that will inform power analyses for a full scale randomized controlled study. Primary outcome measures will be acceptance rates for enrollment in the study, retention rates across both intervention arms, and satisfaction levels with the PST intervention. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and at six weeks (end of PST intervention) and 3 months following baseline.

{"nct_id": "NCT03421483", "title": "Assessing Colonic Folate Absorption & Metabolism", "brief_summary": "Folate, a B-vitamin, is necessary in metabolic processes such as amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. Since folate cannot be synthesized by mammals, it must be consumed as foods and dietary supplements or generated by bacteria present in the colon. There are many known adverse health outcomes associated with folate deficiency in humans such as neural tube defects in newborns and colorectal cancer in adults. It has also been proposed that supra-physiological folate status can also be detrimental since it can lead to changes in immune function and the masking of vitamin B12 deficiency. It is generally believed that dietary sources of folate are primarily absorbed in the small intestine, however recent evidence suggests the colon may play a more significant role in the absorption of folate than previously understood. The aim of this study is to assess how folic acid supplementation influences colonic folate absorption and metabolism in humans. This will be accomplished by assessing the expression of two major folate transporters responsible for folate absorption in the colon. Participants will be randomized to receive multivitamins with either 0 or 400 µg folic acid during a 16-week randomized clinical trial in which blood and colonic tissue biopsies will be collected and analyzed. The total folate concentrations and expression of folate transporters in colonocytes will be measured to confirm levels and evaluate the impact of supplemental folic acid. The expression of two folate hydrolases responsible for converting naturally occurring folate to its bioavailable form will also be evaluated.

As the cancer grows, it blocks the drainage of the bile ducts that carry digestive juices from the gallbladder and pancreas to the small intestine. ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is often prescribed during which a tube with a tiny camera attached is inserted through the subject's mouth and advanced to a place in the small intestine where the bile duct empties. Through this scope the doctor enlarges the ducts with tiny balloons and places plastic or metal stents (straws) that help keep the bile ducts open so they can drain properly. However, due to the cancer, the stents are blocked eventually.\n\nThe purpose of this registry is to record information and evaluate the impact of endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) probes in improving the management of bile duct cancer or pancreatic cancer by ablating the tissue in the bile duct(s) before the stent(s) are implanted.

The major problem is very difficult to discern malignant from non-malignant strictures, such as patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). With the poor prognosis and high mortality rate of advanced stage of hepatopancreaticobiliary malignancies, early and accurate diagnosis impacts patients' outcome and possible surgical candidacy. Therefore, a pre-operative determination of malignancy to help plan appropriate treatment is highly desirable.\n\nBefore 2000s, several diagnostic modalities, including laboratory tests, ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, cholangiography by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography endoscopic (PTC) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and brushing cytology disclosed 13% to 24% false positive rate for suspicious malignant hilar strictures. Compared to recent studies, ERCP brushings still suffer from low sensitivity (41.6% ± 3.2% (99% CI)) and negative predictive value (58.0% ± 3.2% (99% CI)). In order to increase diagnostic accuracy, at least two sampling methods, including brushing cytology, biopsy, and fine-needle aspiration is therefore recommended. One article showed multimodal tissue-sampling (Brushing + Biopsy + Fine-needle aspiration) increased the sensitivity for diagnosis of malignant biliary stricture to 62%. However, no any literature demonstrate the best sequence of combined sampling modalities to yield the highest diagnostic accuracy. Besides, the role of stricture dilation before or after different tissue sampling modality is still uncertain.\n\nIn this study, the investigators want to compare stricture dilation before or after multimodal tissue-sampling, including brush cytology, intraductal suction and forceps biopsy for the diagnosis of malignant biliary stricture and also assess which kind of the sequence of combined tissue-sampling modalities could offer the highest diagnostic accuracy.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Biliary Strictures", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

{"nct_id": "NCT06863324", "title": "Impact of Individual Radiosensitivity on Late Toxicities of Radiosurgery in Essential Trigeminal Neuralgia", "brief_summary": "Trigeminal neuralgia is intense, electric-shock-like facial pain, most often triggered by touch, chewing or speech. It results from dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve, the 5th cranial nerve. In most cases, no cause is found, and trigeminal neuralgia is termed \"essential\". In the first instance, treatment is based on medication. In cases of drug resistance, radiosurgery is a possible treatment option. This involves performing neurolysis, delivering a very high dose of ionizing radiation to the trigeminal nerve. The immediate success rate of radiosurgery is 80-90%.\n\nHowever, in the long term, around 30% of patients experience complications (mainly hypoesthesia of the face on the treated side, paresthesias, masticatory disorders, neuropathic pain) and 30% of patients experience a recurrence of neuralgic pain. Most of these complications are permanent, and there are very few effective treatments, either medical or physical. Recurrence and complications are correlated, i.e. patients with hypoesthesia have a lower risk of recurrence. Certain technical parameters are associated with the efficacy and toxicity of radiosurgery, notably the position of the point of impact of the rays on the nerve. However, for identical treatment techniques, there are currently no known prognostic criteria for the efficacy and toxicity of radiosurgery.\n\nNumerous radiobiological studies have demonstrated that sensitivity to ionizing radiation differs from one individual to another, with each person having his or her own tolerance threshold. Indeed, 5-10% of patients are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and are at very high risk of developing late complications \\[Bentzen et al. 2010\\]. There are currently commercial tests for individual radiosensitivity, based on a simple blood test, whose clinical value has been demonstrated in predicting complications in patients irradiated for breast or prostate cancer. These tests are based on the rate of radiation-induced lymphocyte apoptosis, known as the RILA (Radiation Induced Lymphocyte Apoptosis) score. Numerous teams have shown retrospectively and then prospectively that a high RILA score is significantly correlated with the absence of the development of radiation-induced late adverse events, with a negative predictive value of over 90% (level of evidence 1) \\[Azria et al. 2015; Mirjolet et al. 2016; Talbot et al. 2019\\]. In practical terms, the test gives a lymphocyte apoptosis score for each patient. A cut-off point is set below which the patient is considered \"radiation hypersensitive\".\n\nIn this study, the investigators propose to correlate the RILA score with the occurrence of severe late toxicity in patients treated by radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia.\n\nIn the event of a positive result, this would make it possible either to adapt the radiosurgery technique to minimize the risk of late complications, or to contraindicate radiosurgery and refer patients to other treatment methods.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Trigeminal Neuralgia Treated by Radiosurgery", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

In the past few decades, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and other treatments were continuously improved, however, the mortality of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients was not significantly decreased. For patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, direct surgery is not effective. It is difficult to achieve radical resection by surgery merely, and even if many patients receive surgery, they may eventually have tumor recurrence and poor survival rate.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to explore effective perioperative neoadjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence and improve the postoperative survival rate of patients. According to the reports, the expression of PD-L1 in esophageal cancer was about 41.4%. Therefore, PD-1/ PD-L1 immunocheckpoint inhibitor may become a new method for the treatment of ESCC. Preliminary clinical results showed that immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy provided a synergies antitumor effect.\n\nThe results of the Phase 1b trial evaluating adbelimumab monotherapy as a neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced resectable ESCC demonstrated that patients receiving two cycles of neoadjuvant sequential surgery exhibited favorable safety profiles, with no adverse reactions of grade 3 or higher. The trial reported a major pathological response (MPR) rate of 24%, a pathological complete response (pCR) rate of 8%, a 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of 92%, and a 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate of 100%.

No single way seems perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they both have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. Investigators hope that both will work better together.\n\nInvestigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. They now want to test whether these genetically modified T cells given after chemotherapy will be more effective at killing cancer cells.\n\nThe gene that will be put into the T cells makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.\n\nFor this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells (CD30.CAR T cells) seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.\n\nSeveral studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to accomplish their functions, and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells in circulation. Because of that, doctors may use chemotherapy drugs to decrease the level of circulating T cells prior to the CD30.CAR T cells infusion. This is called \"lymphodepletion\"\n\nCD30.CAR T cells have previously been studied in lymphoma patients.", "phase": "PHASE1", "condition": "Hodgkin's Lymphoma", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": []}

Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (IIH), known as the Jod-Basedow phenomenon is infrequent, but elderly patients and individuals with autonomously functioning nodular goiters are at higher risk of developing this dysfunction. According to recent studies the risk of ICM-induced hyperthyroidism appears to be low. The prevalence has not been well assessed and varies from 1 % to 10 %. Currently, there are no specific guidelines concerning the prophylactic therapy of IIH. American Thyroid Association (ATA) does not recommend routine administration of antithyroid drugs before iodinated contrast medium for all patients, however, advises to consider prophylaxis in patients at high risk of developing IIH or with cardiovascular comorbidities. ATA recommends avoidance of additional iodine and administration of b-blockers alone or with antithyroid drugs as a treatment of IIH, depending on the severity of hyperthyroidism.\n\nThis study was performed to evaluate the influence of ICM on thyroid status and advantages of prophylactic therapy during ICM exposure in patients with euthyroid goiter and cardiovascular comorbidities.

With regard to surgical type, Open liver resection is the optimum choice for CLM patients no matter what the metastasis profile is. And for management of primary tumor, laparoscopic procedure is mature in surgical skill and has been evidenced equivalent overall survival rate compared with open resection.

Implementation of PREM and relevant PROM is essential for equity, better resources utility, accessibility and patient centered treatment.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe investigators describe the EORTC INFO 25 translation process followed by investigation of subpopulation where action is most needed. The investigators investigate which QOL questionnaire better reflects clinical parameters among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients.\n\nDesign:\n\nA prospective cohort.

The diagnostic work-up and therapy for the study population will not differ from the gold standard during the study; only additional diagnostic tools will be implemented, and their value will be analyzed post hoc.\n\nThe 5-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is 9%, but this can be drastically improved if surgery is possible. With its increasing incidence and poor prognosis, pancreatic cancer is becoming a global oncologic challenge where major breakthroughs are still required to improve patient outcomes. Patients with BR or LAPDA typically undergo neoadjuvant treatment with FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy, followed by referral for surgery if a response is observed. In these cases, surgical resectability is difficult to predict based on CT imaging due to the tumor's desmoplastic reaction, which obscures tumor-vessel contact without clear morphological changes. Consequently, patients without tumor progression on CT and with a decreased tumor marker (CA 19-9) are considered for surgical exploration to ensure that no potentially curative treatment is denied. However, the non-specific nature of CA 19-9 and the unreliable spatial changes on CT do not allow for accurate patient stratification. Therefore, alternative diagnostic strategies are needed to better predict resectability, minimizing unnecessary laparotomies while ensuring that potentially curative approaches are not overlooked.\n\nIn this project, the investigator will apply diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), as it has been shown to be useful in assessing tumor response beyond morphological parameters. DW-MRI enables the detection of functional tumor changes, variations in vascularization, and fibrosis without modifications in shape. The statistical evaluation of visual information using radiomics optimizes data analysis, allowing comparisons over time (before and after chemotherapy) and correlation with operative findings (resectable or unresectable tumor).\n\nThe investigator will focus on patients with BR and LAPDA and assess whether a combination of clinical and genetic factors can predict successful surgical resection. To this end, DW-MRI imaging will be complemented by multi-omics profiling in liquid biopsies. Furthermore, the investigator aims to validate, in a prospective patient cohort, the predictive value of recently published single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that regulate cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis.

In observational studies, only observations are made without participants receiving any advice or any changes to healthcare.\n\nNeovascular age-related macular edema (nAMD): an eye disorder caused by the lack of oxygen in the retina. The lack of oxygen leads to the increase of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF causes new, weak blood vessels to grow. These vessels can leak fluid or blood into the central part of the retina at the back of the eye (macula). This leads to blurring or a blind spot in the central (straight ahead) vision needed for reading or threading a needle.\n\nRetinal vein occlusion (RVO): an eye disorder where a blood vessel that carries blood away from the retina (vein) becomes blocked. The blocked vein causes a lack of oxygen in the retina which leads to the increase of VEGF and then vision disturbances.\n\nThese eye disorders can be treated with a type of medicine called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). Anti-VEGF treatment helps control the growth of new blood vessels in the eye and is given via injection into the eye.\n\nDARWEN AI is a system using artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

Screening programmes led to an increase of non-palpable breast lesion detection rates. These patients are often eligible for BCS and an accurate preoperative localization technique for the detection of the lesion is required to guarantee a safe surgical excision. The primary goal of BCS is to obtain a complete resection of the tumor with disease-free surgical margins. The presence of tumor on surgical margins on postoperative histological examination of the specimen increases the risk of local recurrence and it requires a surgical re-excision. For all these reasons different techniques for localization of non-palpable breast lesions have been developed over time. Since '70s the wire guided localization (WGL) technique has represented the gold standard; however it has several limitations such as wire migration or fracture and patient referred discomfort related to wire placement. Over time, other techniques have been proposed, such as the radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL), radioactive and magnetic seeds, carbon dye and ultrasound-guided preoperative localization.\n\nCurrently there are several studies of comparison between the WGL and the more modern techniques. All of these data claim the effectiveness of the new \"wire-free\" methodics ensuring a safe surgical resection with tumor-free margins and, in some cases, a better aesthetic result.\n\nStudies of comparison between the modern techniques are limited.

Currently, the information from a radiological test, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, is used to design the best arrangement of radiation beams which will kill tumor cells and still spare the normal parts of lungs and other normal organs in the chest. The purpose of this study is to explore whether adding information from another radiological test, called positron emission tomography (PET), will improve the accuracy of the radiation beam arrangement designed to treat lung cancer. A PET scan is a way to picture the biochemistry of tissues and organs: of how tissues in the body take up glucose, a normal nutrient of the body. The researchers will attempt to create radiation treatment plans from PET images alone and compare differences between hypothetical plans and standard-of-care CT-based radiation treatment plans. Because there is honest uncertainty about the contribution of PET to radiation treatment planning, it is possible that there will be no difference between a CT-based treatment plan and one resulting from PET information. It is also possible that the addition of PET may result in a radiation beam arrangement that may better control lung cancer. The addition of PET may also result in treating less normal tissues, which may lower the risk of radiation side effects.

To achieve this clear margin, surgeons are apt to use a 1.0 to 1.5 cm safety margin around the gross tumor during surgery, considering 30-50% tumor shrinkage in tissue fixation process.\n\nMany previous retrospective data have been reported to suggest the optimal or proper surgical extent for oral tongue cancer. Wider resection can lead to better local control, however, it sacrifices more normal tissue, resulting in the functional deficit of tongue (speech and swallowing), even with reconstruction.\n\nUnfortunately up to now, no prospective comparison of a different surgical safety margin for oral tongue cancer have been conducted to draw a more solid conclusion. Particularly in early stage oral tongue cancer (cT1-2N0), some study results have suggested that less than 5 mm resection margin in pathology specimens can be also safe and effective in terms of tumor control.\n\nTo achieve a well-grounded result about the proper surgical safety margin in early stage (cT1-2N0) oral tongue cancer, we will compare the outcomes of the two (1.5 cm versus 1.0 cm) surgical safety margin in curative resection for cT1-2N0 oral tongue cancer.", "phase": "NA", "condition": "Tongue Cancer", "study_type": "INTERVENTIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["the efficacy and safety of 1"]}

In the United Kingdom (UK). There is a lack of research looking at vitamin D status of the British African-Caribbean population. This population is particularly at risk to vitamin D deficiency due to possessing a skin type which hinders the production of vitamin D in the skin. Further, due to the geographical location of the UK, there is reduced ability to produce vitamin D due to the low sun exposure (Libon 2013 ). Our main source of vitamin D is through skin exposure to the sun. In the UK, the UV radiation is only strong enough in April-September (Wilson 2017) for the production of vitamin D to occur. In winter months, vitamin D needs to be consumed in food or supplement form. Vitamin D is essential for healthy bones and is associated with reduced risk of certain cancers and immune disorders (Wilson 2017).

The conventional diagnostic work-up of MDS relies on cytomorphological evaluation of bone marrow, which may be complemented by conventional cytogenetic, flow cytometry, and molecular analysis by next generation sequencing techniques.\n\nSuspicion of MDS is the commonest reason for bone marrow aspirate in older patients with unexplained peripheral blood cytopenias. Yet many patients are exposed to unnecessary bone marrow aspiration-related discomfort and harms, because of the limited prevalence of disease among subjects referred for suspected MDS. In this context, a valid and reliable assay based on peripheral blood sample that accurately discriminates MDS from other cytopenia etiologies without requiring invasive bone marrow aspiration is warranted.\n\nThe accuracy of peripheral blood neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression quantified by flow cytometric analysis for the diagnosis of MDS is supported by three primary studies totaling 211 individuals. An intra-individual robust coefficient of variation (RCV) value for neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression lower than 30.0% accurately ruled out MDS, with both sensitivity and negative predictive value point estimates of 100%, in consecutive patients with suspected disease. This biomarker might obviate the need for cytomorphological evaluation of bone marrow aspirate for up to 35% of patients referred for suspected MDS. Although promising, these preliminary results require replication in an independent external validation sample.\n\nThe broad aim of the multicenter MPO-MDS-Valid study project is to prospectively validate the diagnostic accuracy of intra-individual RCV for peripheral blood neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression quantified by flow cytometric analysis among consecutive patients referred for suspected MDS.", "phase": null, "condition": "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "study_type": "OBSERVATIONAL", "extracted_endpoints": ["of the multicenter MPO-MDS-Valid study project is to prospectively validate the diagnostic accuracy of intra-individual RCV for peripheral blood neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression quantified by flow cytometric analysis among consecutive patients referred for suspected MDS"]}

Women living with HIV (WLWH) have a six-fold higher risk of developing precancerous lesions that persist and progress to CC, which is the leading cause of cancer mortality among women in Kenya. Significant support from the Go Further campaign, represented by donors such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the George W. Bush Institute, UNAIDS, Merck, and Roche, to integrate CC screening into HIV clinics represents an exceptional opportunity to scale CC impact across SSA, but only if implementation science evidence is available to inform strategy. Currently, the impact of Go Further has been undermined by fractured linkages to care and insensitive screening methods; in Kenya, less than 2% of WLWH screened have received appropriate treatment. Implementation science studies are needed to better understand and surmount barriers to integrated care in publicly funded HIV clinics.\n\nBroad objective This study seeks to explore and innovate strategies to overcome patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers to implementing CC screening and referral guidelines, link WLWH who require further diagnostic testing and/or treatment with effective and accessible care, and document services for accountability and quality improvement. In this proposal, our team will apply our extensive implementation science expertise and partnerships with Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) to adapt and test evidence-based strategies (e.g., HPV self-testing, care navigators, and the WEMA mHealth app \\[tested and scaled in Tanzania\\]) that address key multi-level barriers identified through a formative, stakeholder-engaged research phase.\n\nMethodology Using the EPIS framework to guide our project, we will: Aim 1a), Explore (engage a multi-disciplinary stakeholder advisory board to co-design the intervention package and prioritize implementation strategies that align with local capacity, opportunities, and motivations; Aim 1b), Prepare (develop tools and strengthen capacity at clinics to implement the strategies; Aim 2), Implement and evaluate the package of implementation strategies via a cluster-randomized stepped wedge trial in 9 clinics (assessing implementation \\[provision of CC screening with HPV self-testing\\] and effectiveness \\[proportion of HPVpositive WLWH who receive subsequent diagnostic triage and/or treatment\\] over months 0-12; and Aim 3), assess Sustainability (costs, cost-effectiveness, and transfer of delivery from study to local staff over months 13-18.\n\nSignificance of the study The overall goal of this study is to employ rigorous empirical methods to adapt and test implementation strategies that expand the scope of HIV care to screen for and treat early precancerous CC lesions in a sustainable, scalable way.

This trial is also testing how well trastuzumab deruxtecan works in treating patients with HER2-low recurrent or metastatic salivary gland cancer. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it works by attaching itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by body's immune system. Trastuzumab emtansine contains trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called emtansine. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers emtansine to kill them. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody called traztuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them.
